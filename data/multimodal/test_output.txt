Preface
REVISED PAGES
The response of students and teachers to the ﬁrst four editions of Linear Algebra and Its
Applications has been most gratifying. This Fifth Edition provides substantial support
both for teaching and for using technology in the course. As before, the text provides
a modern elementary introduction to linear algebra and a broad selection of interest-
ing applications. The material is accessible to students with the maturity that should
come from successful completion of two semesters of college-level mathematics, usu-
ally calculus.
The main goal of the text is to help students master the basic concepts and skills they
will use later in their careers. The topics here follow the recommendations of the Linear
Algebra Curriculum Study Group, which were based on a careful investigation of the
real needs of the students and a consensus among professionals in many disciplines that
use linear algebra. We hope this course will be one of the most useful and interesting
mathematics classes taken by undergraduates.
WHAT'S NEW IN THIS EDITION
The main goals of this revision were to update the exercises, take advantage of improve-
ments in technology, and provide more support for conceptual learning.
1.Support for the Fifth Edition is offered through MyMathLab. MyMathLab, from
Pearson, is the world’s leading online resource in mathematics, integrating interac-
tive homework, assessment, and media in a ﬂexible, easy-to-use format. Students
submit homework online for instantaneous feedback, support, and assessment. This
system works particularly well for computation-based skills. Many additional re-
sources are also provided through the MyMathLab web site.
2.TheFifth Edition of the text is available in an interactive electronic format. Using
the CDF player, a free Mathematica player available from Wolfram, students can
interact with ﬁgures and experiment with matrices by looking at numerous examples
with just the click of a button. The geometry of linear algebra comes alive through
these interactive ﬁgures. Students are encouraged to develop conjectures through
experimentation and then verify that their observations are correct by examining the
relevant theorems and their proofs. The resources in the interactive version of the
text give students the opportunity to play with mathematical objects and ideas much
as we do with our own research. Files for Wolfram CDF Player are also available for
classroom presentations.
3.TheFifth Edition includes additional support for concept- and proof-based learning.
Conceptual Practice Problems and their solutions have been added so that most sec-
tions now have a proof- or concept-based example for students to review. Additional
guidance has also been added to some of the proofs of theorems in the body of the
textbook.

Preface ix
4.More than 25 percent of the exercises are new or updated, especially the computa-
tional exercises. The exercise sets remain one of the most important features of this
book, and these new exercises follow the same high standard of the exercise sets from
the past four editions. They are crafted in a way that reﬂects the substance of each
of the sections they follow, developing the students’ conﬁdence while challenging
them to practice and generalize the new ideas they have encountered.
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
Early Introduction of Key Concepts
Many fundamental ideas of linear algebra are introduced within the ﬁrst seven lectures,
in the concrete setting of Rn, and then gradually examined from different points of view.
Later generalizations of these concepts appear as natural extensions of familiar ideas,
visualized through the geometric intuition developed in Chapter 1. A major achievement
of this text is that the level of difﬁculty is fairly even throughout the course.
A Modern View of Matrix Multiplication
Good notation is crucial, and the text reﬂects the way scientists and engineers actually
use linear algebra in practice. The deﬁnitions and proofs focus on the columns of a ma-
trix rather than on the matrix entries. A central theme is to view a matrix–vector product
Axas a linear combination of the columns of A. This modern approach simpliﬁes many
arguments, and it ties vector space ideas into the study of linear systems.
Linear Transformations
Linear transformations form a “thread” that is woven into the fabric of the text. Their
use enhances the geometric ﬂavor of the text. In Chapter 1, for instance, linear transfor-
mations provide a dynamic and graphical view of matrix–vector multiplication.
Eigenvalues and Dynamical Systems
Eigenvalues appear fairly early in the text, in Chapters 5 and 7. Because this material
is spread over several weeks, students have more time than usual to absorb and review
these critical concepts. Eigenvalues are motivated by and applied to discrete and con-
tinuous dynamical systems, which appear in Sections 1.10, 4.8, and 4.9, and in ﬁve
sections of Chapter 5. Some courses reach Chapter 5 after about ﬁve weeks by covering
Sections 2.8 and 2.9 instead of Chapter 4. These two optional sections present all the
vector space concepts from Chapter 4 needed for Chapter 5.
Orthogonality and Least-Squares Problems
These topics receive a more comprehensive treatment than is commonly found in begin-
ning texts. The Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group has emphasized the need for
a substantial unit on orthogonality and least-squares problems, because orthogonality
plays such an important role in computer calculations and numerical linear algebra and
because inconsistent linear systems arise so often in practical work.

xPreface
PEDAGOGICAL FEATURES
Applications
A broad selection of applications illustrates the power of linear algebra to explain fun-
damental principles and simplify calculations in engineering, computer science, mathe-
matics, physics, biology, economics, and statistics. Some applications appear in separate
sections; others are treated in examples and exercises. In addition, each chapter opens
with an introductory vignette that sets the stage for some application of linear algebra
and provides a motivation for developing the mathematics that follows. Later, the text
returns to that application in a section near the end of the chapter.
A Strong Geometric Emphasis
Every major concept in the course is given a geometric interpretation, because many
students learn better when they can visualize an idea. There are substantially more
drawings here than usual, and some of the ﬁgures have never before appeared in a linear
algebra text. Interactive versions of these ﬁgures, and more, appear in the electronic
version of the textbook.
Examples
This text devotes a larger proportion of its expository material to examples than do most
linear algebra texts. There are more examples than an instructor would ordinarily present
in class. But because the examples are written carefully, with lots of detail, students can
read them on their own.
Theorems and Proofs
Important results are stated as theorems. Other useful facts are displayed in tinted boxes,
for easy reference. Most of the theorems have formal proofs, written with the beginner
student in mind. In a few cases, the essential calculations of a proof are exhibited in a
carefully chosen example. Some routine veriﬁcations are saved for exercises, when they
will beneﬁt students.
Practice Problems
A few carefully selected Practice Problems appear just before each exercise set. Com-
plete solutions follow the exercise set. These problems either focus on potential trouble
spots in the exercise set or provide a “warm-up” for the exercises, and the solutions
often contain helpful hints or warnings about the homework.
Exercises
The abundant supply of exercises ranges from routine computations to conceptual ques-
tions that require more thought. A good number of innovative questions pinpoint con-
ceptual difﬁculties that we have found on student papers over the years. Each exercise
set is carefully arranged in the same general order as the text; homework assignments
are readily available when only part of a section is discussed. A notable feature of the
exercises is their numerical simplicity. Problems “unfold” quickly, so students spend
little time on numerical calculations. The exercises concentrate on teaching understand-
ing rather than mechanical calculations. The exercises in the Fifth Edition maintain the
integrity of the exercises from previous editions, while providing fresh problems for
students and instructors.
Exercises marked with the symbol [ M] are designed to be worked with the aid of a
“Matrix program” (a computer program, such as MATLAB®,MapleTM,Mathematica®,
REVISED PAGES


--- Page 12 ---
Preface xi
MathCad®, or DeriveTM, or a programmable calculator with matrix capabilities, such as
those manufactured by Texas Instruments).
True/False Questions
To encourage students to read all of the text and to think critically, we have devel-
oped 300 simple true/false questions that appear in 33 sections of the text, just after
the computational problems. They can be answered directly from the text, and they
prepare students for the conceptual problems that follow. Students appreciate these
questions—after they get used to the importance of reading the text carefully. Based
on class testing and discussions with students, we decided not to put the answers in the
text. (The Study Guide tells the students where to ﬁnd the answers to the odd-numbered
questions.) An additional 150 true/false questions (mostly at the ends of chapters) test
understanding of the material. The text does provide simple T/F answers to most of
these questions, but it omits the justiﬁcations for the answers (which usually require
some thought).
Writing Exercises
An ability to write coherent mathematical statements in English is essential for all stu-
dents of linear algebra, not just those who may go to graduate school in mathematics.
The text includes many exercises for which a written justiﬁcation is part of the answer.
Conceptual exercises that require a short proof usually contain hints that help a student
get started. For all odd-numbered writing exercises, either a solution is included at the
back of the text or a hint is provided and the solution is given in the Study Guide ,
described below.
Computational Topics
The text stresses the impact of the computer on both the development and practice of
linear algebra in science and engineering. Frequent Numerical Notes draw attention
to issues in computing and distinguish between theoretical concepts, such as matrix
inversion, and computer implementations, such as LU factorizations.
WEB SUPPORT
MyMathLab–Online Homework and Resources
Support for the Fifth Edition is offered through MyMathLab ( www.mymathlab.com ).
MyMathLab from Pearson is the world’s leading online resource in mathematics, inte-
grating interactive homework, assessment, and media in a ﬂexible, easy-to-use format.
MyMathLab contains hundreds of algorithmically generated exercises that mirror those
in the textbook. Students submit homework online for instantaneous feedback, support,
and assessment. This system works particularly well for supporting computation-based
skills. Many additional resources are also provided through the MyMathLab web site.
Interactive Textbook
The Fifth Edition of the text is available in an interactive electronic format within
MyMathLab. Using Wolfram CDF Player, a free Mathematica player available from
Wolfram ( www.wolfram.com/player ), students can interact with ﬁgures and experiment
with matrices by looking at numerous examples. The geometry of linear algebra comes
alive through these interactive ﬁgures. Students are encouraged to develop conjectures
REVISED PAGES

xii Preface
through experimentation, then verify that their observations are correct by examining
the relevant theorems and their proofs. The resources in the interactive version of the
text give students the opportunity to interact with mathematical objects and ideas much
as we do with our own research.
This web site at www.pearsonhighered.com/lay contains all of the support material
referenced below. These materials are also available within MyMathLab.
Review Material
Review sheets and practice exams (with solutions) cover the main topics in the text.
They come directly from courses we have taught in the past years. Each review sheet
identiﬁes key deﬁnitions, theorems, and skills from a speciﬁed portion of the text.
Applications by Chapters
The web site contains seven Case Studies, which expand topics introduced at the begin-
ning of each chapter, adding real-world data and opportunities for further exploration. In
addition, more than 20 Application Projects either extend topics in the text or introduce
new applications, such as cubic splines, airline ﬂight routes, dominance matrices in
sports competition, and error-correcting codes. Some mathematical applications are
integration techniques, polynomial root location, conic sections, quadric surfaces, and
extrema for functions of two variables. Numerical linear algebra topics, such as con-
dition numbers, matrix factorizations, and the QR method for ﬁnding eigenvalues, are
also included. Woven into each discussion are exercises that may involve large data sets
(and thus require technology for their solution).
Getting Started with Technology
If your course includes some work with MATLAB, Maple, Mathematica, or TI calcula-
tors, the Getting Started guides provide a “quick start guide” for students.
Technology-speciﬁc projects are also available to introduce students to software
and calculators. They are available on www.pearsonhighered.com/lay and within
MyMathLab. Finally, the Study Guide provides introductory material for ﬁrst-time
technology users.
Data Files
Hundreds of ﬁles contain data for about 900 numerical exercises in the text, Case
Studies, and Application Projects. The data are available in a variety of formats—for
MATLAB, Maple, Mathematica, and the Texas Instruments graphing calculators. By
allowing students to access matrices and vectors for a particular problem with only a few
keystrokes, the data ﬁles eliminate data entry errors and save time on homework. These
data ﬁles are available for download at www.pearsonhighered.com/lay and MyMathLab.
Projects
Exploratory projects for Mathematica,TMMaple, and MATLAB invite students to dis-
cover basic mathematical and numerical issues in linear algebra. Written by experi-
enced faculty members, these projects are referenced by the icon
WEB at appropriate
points in the text. The projects explore fundamental concepts such as the column space,
diagonalization, and orthogonal projections; several projects focus on numerical issues
such as ﬂops, iterative methods, and the SVD; and a few projects explore applications
such as Lagrange interpolation and Markov chains.

SUPPLEMENTS
Study Guide
A printed version of the Study Guide is available at low cost. It is also available electron-
ically within MyMathLab. The Guide is designed to be an integral part of the course. The
icon
SG in the text directs students to special subsections of the Guide that suggest how
to master key concepts of the course. The Guide supplies a detailed solution to every
third odd-numbered exercise, which allows students to check their work. A complete
explanation is provided whenever an odd-numbered writing exercise has only a “Hint”
in the answers. Frequent “Warnings” identify common errors and show how to prevent
them. MATLAB boxes introduce commands as they are needed. Appendixes in the Study
Guide provide comparable information about Maple, Mathematica, and TI graphing
calculators (ISBN: 0-321-98257-6).
Instructor’s Edition
For the convenience of instructors, this special edition includes brief answers to all
exercises. A Note to the Instructor at the beginning of the text provides a commentary
on the design and organization of the text, to help instructors plan their courses. It also
describes other support available for instructors (ISBN: 0-321-98261-4).
Instructor’s Technology Manuals
Each manual provides detailed guidance for integrating a speciﬁc software package or
graphing calculator throughout the course, written by faculty who have already used
the technology with this text. The following manuals are available to qualiﬁed instruc-
tors through the Pearson Instructor Resource Center, www.pearsonhighered.com/irc and
MyMathLab: MATLAB (ISBN: 0-321-98985-6), Maple (ISBN: 0-134-04726-5),
Mathematica (ISBN: 0-321-98975-9), and TI-83 C/89 (ISBN: 0-321-98984-8).
Instructor’s Solutions Manual
The Instructor’ s Solutions Manual (ISBN 0-321-98259-2) contains detailed solutions
for all exercises, along with teaching notes for many sections. The manual is available
electronically for download in the Instructor Resource Center ( www.pearsonhighered.
com/lay ) and MyMathLab.
PowerPoint®Slides and Other Teaching Tools
A brisk pace at the beginning of the course helps to set the tone for the term. To get
quickly through the ﬁrst two sections in fewer than two lectures, consider using
PowerPoint®slides (ISBN 0-321-98264-9). They permit you to focus on the process
of row reduction rather than to write many numbers on the board. Students can receive
a condensed version of the notes, with occasional blanks to ﬁll in during the lecture.
(Many students respond favorably to this gesture.) The PowerPoint slides are available
for 25 core sections of the text. In addition, about 75 color ﬁgures from the text are
available as PowerPoint slides . The PowerPoint slides are available for download at
www.pearsonhighered.com/irc . Interactive ﬁgures are available as Wolfram CDF Player
ﬁles for classroom demonstrations. These ﬁles provide the instructor with the oppor-
tunity to bring the geometry alive and to encourage students to make conjectures by
looking at numerous examples. The ﬁles are available exclusively within MyMathLab.

TestGen
TestGen ( www.pearsonhighered.com/testgen ) enables instructors to build, edit, print,
and administer tests using a computized bank of questions developed to cover all the
objectives of the text. TestGen is algorithmically based, allowing instructors to create
multiple, but equivalent, versions of the same question or test with the click of a but-
ton. Instructors can also modify test bank questions or add new questions. The soft-
ware and test bank are available for download from Pearson Education’s online catalog.

A Note to Students
This course is potentially the most interesting and worthwhile undergraduate mathe-
matics course you will complete. In fact, some students have written or spoken to us
after graduation and said that they still use this text occasionally as a reference in their
careers at major corporations and engineering graduate schools. The following remarks
offer some practical advice and information to help you master the material and enjoy
the course.
In linear algebra, the concepts are as important as the computations. The simple
numerical exercises that begin each exercise set only help you check your understanding
of basic procedures. Later in your career, computers will do the calculations, but you
will have to choose the calculations, know how to interpret the results, and then explain
the results to other people. For this reason, many exercises in the text ask you to explain
or justify your calculations. A written explanation is often required as part of the answer.
For odd-numbered exercises, you will ﬁnd either the desired explanation or at least a
good hint. You must avoid the temptation to look at such answers before you have tried
to write out the solution yourself. Otherwise, you are likely to think you understand
something when in fact you do not.
To master the concepts of linear algebra, you will have to read and reread the text
carefully. New terms are in boldface type, sometimes enclosed in a deﬁnition box. A
glossary of terms is included at the end of the text. Important facts are stated as theorems
or are enclosed in tinted boxes, for easy reference. We encourage you to read the ﬁrst
ﬁve pages of the Preface to learn more about the structure of this text. This will give
you a framework for understanding how the course may proceed.
In a practical sense, linear algebra is a language. You must learn this language the
same way you would a foreign language—with daily work. Material presented in one
section is not easily understood unless you have thoroughly studied the text and worked
the exercises for the preceding sections. Keeping up with the course will save you lots
of time and distress!
Numerical Notes
We hope you read the Numerical Notes in the text, even if you are not using a computer
or graphing calculator with the text. In real life, most applications of linear algebra
involve numerical computations that are subject to some numerical error, even though
that error may be extremely small. The Numerical Notes will warn you of potential
difﬁculties in using linear algebra later in your career, and if you study the notes now,
you are more likely to remember them later.
If you enjoy reading the Numerical Notes, you may want to take a course later in
numerical linear algebra. Because of the high demand for increased computing power,
computer scientists and mathematicians work in numerical linear algebra to develop
faster and more reliable algorithms for computations, and electrical engineers design
faster and smaller computers to run the algorithms. This is an exciting ﬁeld, and your
ﬁrst course in linear algebra will help you prepare for it.

Study Guide
To help you succeed in this course, we suggest that you purchase the Study
Guide (www.mypearsonstore.com ; 0-321-98257-6). It is available electronically within
MyMathLab. Not only will it help you learn linear algebra, it also will show you how to
study mathematics. At strategic points in your textbook, the icon
SG will direct you to
special subsections in the Study Guide entitled “Mastering Linear Algebra Concepts.”
There you will ﬁnd suggestions for constructing effective review sheets of key concepts.
The act of preparing the sheets is one of the secrets to success in the course, because
you will construct links between ideas. These links are the “glue” that enables you to
build a solid foundation for learning and remembering the main concepts in the course.
TheStudy Guide contains a detailed solution to every third odd-numbered exercise,
plus solutions to all odd-numbered writing exercises for which only a hint is given in the
Answers section of this book. The Guide is separate from the text because you must learn
to write solutions by yourself, without much help. (We know from years of experience
that easy access to solutions in the back of the text slows the mathematical development
of most students.) The Guide also provides warnings of common errors and helpful hints
that call attention to key exercises and potential exam questions.
If you have access to technology—MATLAB, Maple, Mathematica, or a TI graph-
ing calculator—you can save many hours of homework time. The Study Guide is
your “lab manual” that explains how to use each of these matrix utilities. It intro-
duces new commands when they are needed. You can download from the web site
www.pearsonhighered.com/lay the data for more than 850 exercises in the text. (With
a few keystrokes, you can display any numerical homework problem on your screen.)
Special matrix commands will perform the computations for you!
What you do in your ﬁrst few weeks of studying this course will set your pattern
for the term and determine how well you ﬁnish the course. Please read “How to Study
Linear Algebra” in the Study Guide as soon as possible. Many students have found the
strategies there very helpful, and we hope you will, too.

1Linear Equations in
Linear Algebra
INTRODUCTORY EXAMPLE
Linear Models in Economics
and Engineering
It was late summer in 1949. Harvard Professor Wassily
Leontief was carefully feeding the last of his punched cards
into the university’s Mark II computer. The cards contained
information about the U.S. economy and represented a
summary of more than 250,000 pieces of information
produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics after two
years of intensive work. Leontief had divided the U.S.
economy into 500 “sectors,” such as the coal industry,
the automotive industry, communications, and so on.
For each sector, he had written a linear equation that
described how the sector distributed its output to the other
sectors of the economy. Because the Mark II, one of the
largest computers of its day, could not handle the resulting
system of 500 equations in 500 unknowns, Leontief had
distilled the problem into a system of 42 equations in
42 unknowns.
Programming the Mark II computer for Leontief’s 42
equations had required several months of effort, and he
was anxious to see how long the computer would take to
solve the problem. The Mark II hummed and blinked for 56
hours before ﬁnally producing a solution. We will discuss
the nature of this solution in Sections 1.6 and 2.6.
Leontief, who was awarded the 1973 Nobel Prize
in Economic Science, opened the door to a new era
in mathematical modeling in economics. His effortsat Harvard in 1949 marked one of the ﬁrst signiﬁcant
uses of computers to analyze what was then a large-
scale mathematical model. Since that time, researchers
in many other ﬁelds have employed computers to analyze
mathematical models. Because of the massive amounts of
data involved, the models are usually linear ; that is, they
are described by systems of linear equations .
The importance of linear algebra for applications has
risen in direct proportion to the increase in computing
power, with each new generation of hardware and
software triggering a demand for even greater capabilities.
Computer science is thus intricately linked with linear
algebra through the explosive growth of parallel processing
and large-scale computations.
Scientists and engineers now work on problems far
more complex than even dreamed possible a few decades
ago. Today, linear algebra has more potential value for
students in many scientiﬁc and business ﬁelds than any
other undergraduate mathematics subject! The material in
this text provides the foundation for further work in many
interesting areas. Here are a few possibilities; others will
be described later.
Oil exploration. When a ship searches for offshore
oil deposits, its computers solve thousands of
separate systems of linear equations every day .

The seismic data for the equations are obtained
from underwater shock waves created by explosions
from air guns. The waves bounce off subsurface
rocks and are measured by geophones attached to
mile-long cables behind the ship.
Linear programming. Many important management
decisions today are made on the basis of linear
programming models that use hundreds of variables.
The airline industry, for instance, employs linearprograms that schedule ﬂight crews, monitor the
locations of aircraft, or plan the varied schedules of
support services such as maintenance and terminal
operations.
Electrical networks. Engineers use simulation
software to design electrical circuits and microchips
involving millions of transistors. Such software
relies on linear algebra techniques and systems of
linear equations.

Systems of linear equations lie at the heart of linear algebra, and this chapter uses them
to introduce some of the central concepts of linear algebra in a simple and concrete
setting. Sections 1.1 and 1.2 present a systematic method for solving systems of linear
equations. This algorithm will be used for computations throughout the text. Sections 1.3
and 1.4 show how a system of linear equations is equivalent to a vector equation and to a
matrix equation . This equivalence will reduce problems involving linear combinations
of vectors to questions about systems of linear equations. The fundamental concepts of
spanning, linear independence, and linear transformations, studied in the second half of
the chapter, will play an essential role throughout the text as we explore the beauty and
power of linear algebra.
1.1 SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS
Alinear equation in the variables x1; : : : ; x nis an equation that can be written in the
form
a1x1Ca2x2C    C anxnDb (1)
where band the coefﬁcients a1; : : : ; a nare real or complex numbers, usually known
in advance. The subscript nmay be any positive integer. In textbook examples and
exercises, nis normally between 2 and 5. In real-life problems, nmight be 50 or 5000,
or even larger.
The equations
4x1 5x2C2Dx1and x2D2 p
6 x1
Cx3
are both linear because they can be rearranged algebraically as in equation (1):
3x1 5x2D  2and 2x1Cx2 x3D2p
6
The equations
4x1 5x2Dx1x2and x2D2px1 6
are not linear because of the presence of x1x2in the ﬁrst equation andpx1in the second.
Asystem of linear equations (or a linear system ) is a collection of one or more
linear equations involving the same variables—say, x1; : : : ; x n. An example is
2x1 x2C1:5x 3D8
x1  4x3D  7(2)
SECOND REVISED PAGES


--- Page 20 ---
1.1Systems of Linear Equations 3
Asolution of the system is a list .s1; s2; : : : ; s n/of numbers that makes each equation a
true statement when the values s1; : : : ; s nare substituted for x1; : : : ; x n, respectively. For
instance, .5; 6:5; 3/ is a solution of system (2) because, when these values are substituted
in (2) for x1; x2; x3, respectively, the equations simplify to 8D8and 7D  7.
The set of all possible solutions is called the solution set of the linear system. Two
linear systems are called equivalent if they have the same solution set. That is, each
solution of the ﬁrst system is a solution of the second system, and each solution of the
second system is a solution of the ﬁrst.
Finding the solution set of a system of two linear equations in two variables is easy
because it amounts to ﬁnding the intersection of two lines. A typical problem is
x1 2x2D  1
 x1C3x2D3
The graphs of these equations are lines, which we denote by `1and`2. A pair of numbers
.x1; x2/satisﬁes both equations in the system if and only if the point .x1; x2/lies on both
`1and`2. In the system above, the solution is the single point .3; 2/ , as you can easily
verify. See Figure 1.

Of course, two lines need not intersect in a single point—they could be parallel, or
they could coincide and hence “intersect” at every point on the line. Figure 2 shows the
graphs that correspond to the following systems:

4CHAPTER 1 Linear Equations in Linear Algebra
A system of linear equations has
1.no solution, or
2.exactly one solution, or
3.inﬁnitely many solutions.
A system of linear equations is said to be consistent if it has either one solution or
inﬁnitely many solutions; a system is inconsistent if it has no solution.
Matrix Notation
The essential information of a linear system can be recorded compactly in a rectangular
array called a matrix . Given the system
x1 2x2Cx3D0
2x2 8x3D8
5x1  5x3D10(3)
with the coefﬁcients of each variable aligned in columns, the matrix
2
41 2 1
0 2  8
5 0  53
5
is called the coefﬁcient matrix (ormatrix of coefﬁcients ) of the system (3), and
2
41 2 1 0
0 2  8 8
5 0  5 103
5 (4)
is called the augmented matrix of the system. (The second row here contains a zero
because the second equation could be written as 0x1C2x2 8x3D8.) An augmented
matrix of a system consists of the coefﬁcient matrix with an added column containing
the constants from the right sides of the equations.
Thesizeof a matrix tells how many rows and columns it has. The augmented matrix
(4) above has 3 rows and 4 columns and is called a 34(read “3 by 4”) matrix. If mand
nare positive integers, an mnmatrix is a rectangular array of numbers with mrows
andncolumns. (The number of rows always comes ﬁrst.) Matrix notation will simplify
the calculations in the examples that follow.
Solving a Linear System
This section and the next describe an algorithm, or a systematic procedure, for solving
linear systems. The basic strategy is to replace one system with an equivalent system
(i.e., one with the same solution set) that is easier to solve .
Roughly speaking, use the x1term in the ﬁrst equation of a system to eliminate the
x1terms in the other equations. Then use the x2term in the second equation to eliminate
thex2terms in the other equations, and so on, until you ﬁnally obtain a very simple
equivalent system of equations.
Three basic operations are used to simplify a linear system: Replace one equation
by the sum of itself and a multiple of another equation, interchange two equations, and
multiply all the terms in an equation by a nonzero constant. After the ﬁrst example, you
will see why these three operations do not change the solution set of the system.

1.1Systems of Linear Equations 5
EXAMPLE 1 Solve system (3).
SOLUTION The elimination procedure is shown here with and without matrix notation,
and the results are placed side by side for comparison:
x1 2x2Cx3D0

5x1  5x3D102
41 2 1 0
0 2  8 8
5 0  5 103
5
Keep x1in the ﬁrst equation and eliminate it from the other equations. To do so, add  5
times equation 1 to equation 3. After some practice, this type of calculation is usually
performed mentally:
 5equation 1
Cequation 3
new equation 3 5x1C10x 2 5x3D0
5x1  5x3D10
10x 2 10x 3D10
The result of this calculation is written in place of the original third equation:
x1 2x2C x3D0
2x2 8x3D8
10x 2 10x 3D102
41 2 1 0
0 2  8 8
0 10  10 103
5
Now, multiply equation 2 by1
2in order to obtain 1 as the coefﬁcient for x2. (This
calculation will simplify the arithmetic in the next step.)
x1 2x2C x3D0

Use the x2in equation 2 to eliminate the 10x 2in equation 3. The “mental’’ computation
is

new equation 3 10x 2C40x 3D  40
10x 2 10x 3D10

The result of this calculation is written in place of the previous third equation (row):
x1 2x2C x3D 0
x2 4x3D 4
30x 3D  302
41 2 1 0
0 1  4 4
0 0 30  303
5
Now, multiply equation 3 by1
30in order to obtain 1 as the coefﬁcient for x3. (This
calculation will simplify the arithmetic in the next step.)
x1 2x2Cx3D0
x2 4x3D4

The new system has a triangular form (the intuitive term triangular will be replaced by
a precise term in the next section):

6CHAPTER 1 Linear Equations in Linear Algebra
Eventually, you want to eliminate the  2x2term from equation 1, but it is more efﬁcient
to use the x3in equation 3 ﬁrst, to eliminate the  4x3andCx3terms in equations 2 and 1.
The two “mental” calculations are
4equation 3
Cequation 2
new equation 24x3D  4

x2 D0 1equation 3
Cequation 1
new equation 1 x3D1
x1 2x2Cx3D0
x1 2x2 D1
It is convenient to combine the results of these two operations:
x1 2x2D1
x2D0
x3D  12
41 2 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1  13
5
Now, having cleaned out the column above the x3in equation 3, move back to the x2in
equation 2 and use it to eliminate the  2x2above it. Because of the previous work with
x3, there is now no arithmetic involving x3terms. Add 2 times equation 2 to equation 1
and obtain the system:
x1 D1
x2D0
x3D  12
41 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
0 0 1  13

The work is essentially done. It shows that the only solution of the original system is
x2x3

.1; 0; 1/. However, since there are so many calculations involved, it is a good practice
to check the work. To verify that .1; 0; 1/isa solution, substitute these values into the
left side of the original system, and compute:
1.1/ 2.0/C1. 1/D1 0 1D0
2.0/ 8. 1/D 0C8D8
5.1/  5. 1/D5 C5D10
The results agree with the right side of the original system, so .1; 0; 1/is a solution of
the system.
Example 1 illustrates how operations on equations in a linear system correspond to
operations on the appropriate rows of the augmented matrix. The three basic operations
listed earlier correspond to the following operations on the augmented matrix.
ELEMENTARY ROW OPERATIONS
1.(Replacement) Replace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another
row.1
2.(Interchange) Interchange two rows.
3.(Scaling) Multiply all entries in a row by a nonzero constant.
Row operations can be applied to any matrix, not merely to one that arises as the
augmented matrix of a linear system. Two matrices are called row equivalent if there
is a sequence of elementary row operations that transforms one matrix into the other.
It is important to note that row operations are reversible . If two rows are inter-
changed, they can be returned to their original positions by another interchange. If a
1A common paraphrase of row replacement is “Add to one row a multiple of another row.”

1.1Systems of Linear Equations 7
row is scaled by a nonzero constant c, then multiplying the new row by 1=cproduces
the original row. Finally, consider a replacement operation involving two rows—say,
rows 1 and 2—and suppose that ctimes row 1 is added to row 2 to produce a new row
2. To “reverse” this operation, add  ctimes row 1 to (new) row 2 and obtain the original
row 2. See Exercises 29–32 at the end of this section.
At the moment, we are interested in row operations on the augmented matrix of a
system of linear equations. Suppose a system is changed to a new one via row operations.
By considering each type of row operation, you can see that any solution of the original
system remains a solution of the new system. Conversely, since the original system can
be produced via row operations on the new system, each solution of the new system is
also a solution of the original system. This discussion justiﬁes the following statement.
If the augmented matrices of two linear systems are row equivalent, then the two
systems have the same solution set.
Though Example 1 is lengthy, you will ﬁnd that after some practice, the calculations
go quickly. Row operations in the text and exercises will usually be extremely easy to
perform, allowing you to focus on the underlying concepts. Still, you must learn to
perform row operations accurately because they will be used throughout the text.
The rest of this section shows how to use row operations to determine the size of a
solution set, without completely solving the linear system.
Existence and Uniqueness Questions
Section 1.2 will show why a solution set for a linear system contains either no solutions,
one solution, or inﬁnitely many solutions. Answers to the following two questions will
determine the nature of the solution set for a linear system.
To determine which possibility is true for a particular system, we ask two questions.
TWO FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT A LINEAR SYSTEM
1.Is the system consistent; that is, does at least one solution exist?
2.If a solution exists, is it the only one; that is, is the solution unique ?
These two questions will appear throughout the text, in many different guises. This
section and the next will show how to answer these questions via row operations on
the augmented matrix.
EXAMPLE 2 Determine if the following system is consistent:
x1 2x2Cx3D0
2x2 8x3D8
5x1  5x3D10

row operations necessary to obtain the triangular form

At this point, we know x3. Were we to substitute the value of x3into equation 2, we
could compute x2and hence could determine x1from equation 1. So a solution exists;
the system is consistent. (In fact, x2is uniquely determined by equation 2 since x3has
only one possible value, and x1is therefore uniquely determined by equation 1. So the
solution is unique.)
EXAMPLE 3 Determine if the following system is consistent:

The equation 0D15is a short form of 0x1C0x2C0x3D15. This system in trian-
gular form obviously has a built-in contradiction. There are no values of x1; x2; x3that
satisfy (8) because the equation 0D15is never true. Since (8) and (5) have the same
solution set, the original system is inconsistent (i.e., has no solution).

x3
The system is inconsistent because
there is no point that lies on all
three planes.
Pay close attention to the augmented matrix in (7). Its last row is typical of an
inconsistent system in triangular form.

N U M E R I C A L N O T E
In real-world problems, systems of linear equations are solved by a computer.
For a square coefﬁcient matrix, computer programs nearly always use the elim-
ination algorithm given here and in Section 1.2, modiﬁed slightly for improved
accuracy.
The vast majority of linear algebra problems in business and industry are
solved with programs that use ﬂoating point arithmetic . Numbers are represented
as decimals :d1  dp10r, where ris an integer and the number pof digits to
the right of the decimal point is usually between 8 and 16. Arithmetic with such
numbers typically is inexact, because the result must be rounded (or truncated)
to the number of digits stored. “Roundoff error” is also introduced when a
number such as 1=3is entered into the computer, since its decimal representation
must be approximated by a ﬁnite number of digits. Fortunately, inaccuracies in
ﬂoating point arithmetic seldom cause problems. The numerical notes in this
book will occasionally warn of issues that you may need to consider later in your
career.

An important concern in the study of heat transfer is to determine
the steady-state temperature distribution of a thin plate when the
temperature around the boundary is known. Assume the plate
shown in the ﬁgure represents a cross section of a metal beam,
with negligible heat ﬂow in the direction perpendicular to the
plate. Let T1; : : : ; T 4denote the temperatures at the four interior
nodes of the mesh in the ﬁgure. The temperature at a node is
approximately equal to the average of the four nearest nodes—
to the left, above, to the right, and below.2For instance,

SOLUTIONS TO PRACTICE PROBLEMS
1.a.For “hand computation,” the best choice is to interchange equations 3 and 4.
Another possibility is to multiply equation 3 by 1=5. Or, replace equation 4 by
its sum with  1=5times row 3. (In any case, do not use the x2in equation 2 to
eliminate the 4x2in equation 1. Wait until a triangular form has been reached and
thex3terms and x4terms have been eliminated from the ﬁrst two equations.)
b.The system is in triangular form. Further simpliﬁcation begins with the x4in the
fourth equation. Use the x4to eliminate all x4terms above it. The appropriate
SECOND REVISED PAGES


--- Page 29 ---
12 CHAPTER 1 Linear Equations in Linear Algebra
step now is to add 2 times equation 4 to equation 1. (After that, move to equa-
tion 3, multiply it by 1=2, and then use the equation to eliminate the x3terms
above it.)
2.The system corresponding to the augmented matrix is
x1C5x2C2x3D  6
4x2 7x3D2
5x3D0
The third equation makes x3D0, which is certainly an allowable value for x3. After
eliminating the x3terms in equations 1 and 2, you could go on to solve for unique
values for x2andx1. Hence a solution exists, and it is unique. Contrast this situation
with that in Example 3.
3.It is easy to check if a speciﬁc list of numbers is a solution. Set x1D3,x2D4, and
x3D  2, and ﬁnd that
5.3/ .4/C2. 2/D15 4 4D7
 2.3/C6.4/C9. 2/D   6C24 18D0
 7.3/C5.4/ 3. 2/D  21C20C6D5
Although the ﬁrst two equations are satisﬁed, the third is not, so .3; 4; 2/is not a
solution of the system. Notice the use of parentheses when making the substitutions.
They are strongly recommended as a guard against arithmetic errors.
x3
x2x1
(3, 4, /H110022)Since .3; 4; 2/satisﬁes the ﬁrst
two equations, it is on the line of
the intersection of the ﬁrst two
planes. Since .3; 4; 2/does not
satisfy all three equations, it does
not lie on all three planes.
4.When the second equation is replaced by its sum with 3 times the ﬁrst equation, the
system becomes

IfkC3his nonzero, the system has no solution. The system is consistent for any
values of handkthat make kC3hD0.
1.2 ROW REDUCTION AND ECHELON FORMS
This section reﬁnes the method of Section 1.1 into a row reduction algorithm that will
enable us to analyze any system of linear equations.1By using only the ﬁrst part of
the algorithm, we will be able to answer the fundamental existence and uniqueness
questions posed in Section 1.1.
The algorithm applies to any matrix, whether or not the matrix is viewed as an
augmented matrix for a linear system. So the ﬁrst part of this section concerns an arbi-
trary rectangular matrix and begins by introducing two important classes of matrices that
include the “triangular” matrices of Section 1.1. In the deﬁnitions that follow, a nonzero
row or column in a matrix means a row or column that contains at least one nonzero
entry; a leading entry of a row refers to the leftmost nonzero entry (in a nonzero row).
1The algorithm here is a variant of what is commonly called Gaussian elimination . A similar elimination
method for linear systems was used by Chinese mathematicians in about 250 B.C.The process was unknown
in Western culture until the nineteenth century, when a famous German mathematician, Carl Friedrich Gauss,
discovered it. A German engineer, Wilhelm Jordan, popularized the algorithm in an 1888 text on geodesy.

1.2Row Reduction and Echelon Forms 13
D E F I N I T I O N A rectangular matrix is in echelon form (orrow echelon form ) if it has the
following three properties:
1.All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros.
2.Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of
the row above it.
3.All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros.
If a matrix in echelon form satisﬁes the following additional conditions, then it is
inreduced echelon form (orreduced row echelon form ):
4.The leading entry in each nonzero row is 1.
5.Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column.
Anechelon matrix (respectively, reduced echelon matrix ) is one that is in echelon
form (respectively, reduced echelon form). Property 2 says that the leading entries form
anechelon (“steplike”) pattern that moves down and to the right through the matrix.
Property 3 is a simple consequence of property 2, but we include it for emphasis.
The “triangular” matrices of Section 1.1, such as2

are in echelon form. In fact, the second matrix is in reduced echelon form. Here are
additional examples.
EXAMPLE 1 The following matrices are in echelon form. The leading entries ( )
may have any nonzero value; the starred entries ( ) may have any value (including zero).

and there are 0’s below and above each leading 1.

Any nonzero matrix may be row reduced (that is, transformed by elementary row
operations) into more than one matrix in echelon form, using different sequences of row
operations. However, the reduced echelon form one obtains from a matrix is unique. The
following theorem is proved in Appendix A at the end of the text.
T H E O R E M 1 Uniqueness of the Reduced Echelon Form
Each matrix is row equivalent to one and only one reduced echelon matrix.
SECOND REVISED PAGES


--- Page 31 ---
14 CHAPTER 1 Linear Equations in Linear Algebra
If a matrix Ais row equivalent to an echelon matrix U, we call Uan echelon form
(or row echelon form) ofA; ifUis in reduced echelon form, we call Uthe reduced
echelon form of A. [Most matrix programs and calculators with matrix capabilities
use the abbreviation RREF for reduced (row) echelon form. Some use REF for (row)
echelon form.]
Pivot Positions
When row operations on a matrix produce an echelon form, further row operations to
obtain the reduced echelon form do not change the positions of the leading entries. Since
the reduced echelon form is unique, the leading entries are always in the same positions
in any echelon form obtained from a given matrix. These leading entries correspond to
leading 1’s in the reduced echelon form.
D E F I N I T I O N Apivot position in a matrix Ais a location in Athat corresponds to a leading 1
in the reduced echelon form of A. Apivot column is a column of Athat contains
a pivot position.
In Example 1, the squares ( ) identify the pivot positions. Many fundamental con-
cepts in the ﬁrst four chapters will be connected in one way or another with pivot
positions in a matrix.
EXAMPLE 2 Row reduce the matrix Abelow to echelon form, and locate the pivot
columns of A.

SOLUTION Use the same basic strategy as in Section 1.1. The top of the leftmost
nonzero column is the ﬁrst pivot position. A nonzero entry, or pivot , must be placed
in this position. A good choice is to interchange rows 1 and 4 (because the mental
computations in the next step will not involve fractions).

The matrix in (2) is different from any encountered in Section 1.1. There is no way to
create a leading entry in column 3! (We can’t use row 1 or 2 because doing so would
destroy the echelon arrangement of the leading entries already produced.) However, if
we interchange rows 3 and 4, we can produce a leading entry in column 4.

Apivot , as illustrated in Example 2, is a nonzero number in a pivot position that is
used as needed to create zeros via row operations. The pivots in Example 2 were 1, 2,
and 5. Notice that these numbers are not the same as the actual elements of Ain the
highlighted pivot positions shown in (3).
With Example 2 as a guide, we are ready to describe an efﬁcient procedure for
transforming a matrix into an echelon or reduced echelon matrix. Careful study and
mastery of this procedure now will pay rich dividends later in the course.
The Row Reduction Algorithm
The algorithm that follows consists of four steps, and it produces a matrix in echelon
form. A ﬁfth step produces a matrix in reduced echelon form. We illustrate the algorithm
by an example.
EXAMPLE 3 Apply elementary row operations to transform the following matrix
ﬁrst into echelon form and then into reduced echelon form:2

Begin with the leftmost nonzero column. This is a pivot column. The pivot
position is at the top.

Use row replacement operations to create zeros in all positions below the pivot.
As a preliminary step, we could divide the top row by the pivot, 3. But with two 3’s in

Cover (or ignore) the row containing the pivot position and cover all rows, if any,
above it. Apply steps 1–3 to the submatrix that remains. Repeat the process until
there are no more nonzero rows to modify.
With row 1 covered, step 1 shows that column 2 is the next pivot column; for step 2,
select as a pivot the “top” entry in that column.

When we cover the row containing the second pivot position for step 4, we are left with
a new submatrix having only one row:

Steps 1–3 require no work for this submatrix, and we have reached an echelon form of
the full matrix. If we want the reduced echelon form, we perform one more step.
STEP 5
Beginning with the rightmost pivot and working upward and to the left, create
zeros above each pivot. If a pivot is not 1, make it 1 by a scaling operation.
The rightmost pivot is in row 3. Create zeros above it, adding suitable multiples of row
3 to rows 2 and 1.

This is the reduced echelon form of the original matrix.
The combination of steps 1–4 is called the forward phase of the row reduction
algorithm. Step 5, which produces the unique reduced echelon form, is called the back-
ward phase .

In step 2 above, a computer program usually selects as a pivot the entry in a
column having the largest absolute value. This strategy, called partial pivoting ,
is used because it reduces roundoff errors in the calculations.

Solutions of Linear Systems
The row reduction algorithm leads directly to an explicit description of the solution set
of a linear system when the algorithm is applied to the augmented matrix of the system.
Suppose, for example, that the augmented matrix of a linear system has been
changed into the equivalent reduced echelon form

There are three variables because the augmented matrix has four columns. The
associated system of equations is
x1 5x3D1
x2Cx3D4
0D0(4)
The variables x1andx2corresponding to pivot columns in the matrix are called basic
variables .2The other variable, x3, is called a free variable .
Whenever a system is consistent, as in (4), the solution set can be described
explicitly by solving the reduced system of equations for the basic variables in terms of
the free variables. This operation is possible because the reduced echelon form places
each basic variable in one and only one equation. In (4), solve the ﬁrst equation for x1
and the second for x2. (Ignore the third equation; it offers no restriction on the variables.)

The statement “ x3is free” means that you are free to choose any value for x3. Once
that is done, the formulas in (5) determine the values for x1andx2. For instance, when
x3D0, the solution is .1; 4; 0/ ; when x3D1, the solution is .6; 3; 1/ .Each different
choice of x3determines a (different) solution of the system, and every solution of the
system is determined by a choice of x3.

There are ﬁve variables because the augmented matrix has six columns. The associated
system now is
x1C6x2C3x4D0
x3 4x4D5
x5D7(6)
The pivot columns of the matrix are 1, 3, and 5, so the basic variables are x1,x3, and x5.
The remaining variables, x2andx4, must be free. Solve for the basic variables to obtain
the general solution:8

Note that the value of x5is already ﬁxed by the third equation in system (6).
Parametric Descriptions of Solution Sets
The descriptions in (5) and (7) are parametric descriptions of solution sets in which
the free variables act as parameters. Solving a system amounts to ﬁnding a parametric
description of the solution set or determining that the solution set is empty.
Whenever a system is consistent and has free variables, the solution set has many
parametric descriptions. For instance, in system (4), we may add 5 times equation 2 to
equation 1 and obtain the equivalent system
x1C5x2 D21
x2Cx3D4
We could treat x2as a parameter and solve for x1andx3in terms of x2, and we would
have an accurate description of the solution set. However, to be consistent, we make the
(arbitrary) convention of always using the free variables as the parameters for describing
a solution set. (The answer section at the end of the text also reﬂects this convention.)
Whenever a system is inconsistent, the solution set is empty, even when the system
has free variables. In this case, the solution set has noparametric representation.
Back-Substitution
Consider the following system, whose augmented matrix is in echelon form but is not
in reduced echelon form:
x1 7x2C2x3 5x4C8x5D10
x2 3x3C3x4Cx5D  5
x4 x5D4
A computer program would solve this system by back-substitution, rather than by com-
puting the reduced echelon form. That is, the program would solve equation 3 for x4in
terms of x5and substitute the expression for x4into equation 2, solve equation 2 for x2,
and then substitute the expressions for x2andx4into equation 1 and solve for x1.
Our matrix format for the backward phase of row reduction, which produces the re-
duced echelon form, has the same number of arithmetic operations as back-substitution.
But the discipline of the matrix format substantially reduces the likelihood of errors

during hand computations. The best strategy is to use only the reduced echelon form
to solve a system! The Study Guide that accompanies this text offers several helpful
suggestions for performing row operations accurately and rapidly.
N U M E R I C A L N O T E
In general, the forward phase of row reduction takes much longer than the
backward phase. An algorithm for solving a system is usually measured in ﬂops
(or ﬂoating point operations). A ﬂop is one arithmetic operation ( C; ;; =)
on two real ﬂoating point numbers.3For an n.nC1/matrix, the reduction
to echelon form can take 2n3=3Cn2=2 7n=6 ﬂops (which is approximately
2n3=3ﬂops when nis moderately large—say, n30/. In contrast, further
reduction to reduced echelon form needs at most n2ﬂops.
Existence and Uniqueness Questions
Although a nonreduced echelon form is a poor tool for solving a system, this form is
just the right device for answering two fundamental questions posed in Section 1.1.
EXAMPLE 5 Determine the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the system

5 (8)
The basic variables are x1,x2, and x5; the free variables are x3andx4. There is no
equation such as 0D1that would indicate an inconsistent system, so we could use
back-substitution to ﬁnd a solution. But the existence of a solution is already clear in
(8). Also, the solution is not unique because there are free variables. Each different
choice of x3andx4determines a different solution. Thus the system has inﬁnitely many
solutions.
When a system is in echelon form and contains no equation of the form 0Db, with
bnonzero, every nonzero equation contains a basic variable with a nonzero coefﬁcient.
Either the basic variables are completely determined (with no free variables) or at least
one of the basic variables may be expressed in terms of one or more free variables. In
the former case, there is a unique solution; in the latter case, there are inﬁnitely many
solutions (one for each choice of values for the free variables).
These remarks justify the following theorem.
3Traditionally, a ﬂopwas only a multiplication or division, because addition and subtraction took much less
time and could be ignored. The deﬁnition of ﬂopgiven here is preferred now, as a result of advances in
computer architecture. See Golub and Van Loan, Matrix Computations , 2nd ed. (Baltimore: The Johns
Hopkins Press, 1989), pp. 19–20.

1.2Row Reduction and Echelon Forms 21
T H E O R E M 2 Existence and Uniqueness Theorem
A linear system is consistent if and only if the rightmost column of the augmented
matrix is nota pivot column—that is, if and only if an echelon form of the
augmented matrix has norow of the form
0  0 b  withbnonzero
If a linear system is consistent, then the solution set contains either (i) a unique
solution, when there are no free variables, or (ii) inﬁnitely many solutions, when
there is at least one free variable.
The following procedure outlines how to ﬁnd and describe all solutions of a linear
system.
USING ROW REDUCTION TO SOLVE A LINEAR SYSTEM
1.Write the augmented matrix of the system.
2.Use the row reduction algorithm to obtain an equivalent augmented matrix in
echelon form. Decide whether the system is consistent. If there is no solution,
stop; otherwise, go to the next step.
3.Continue row reduction to obtain the reduced echelon form.
4.Write the system of equations corresponding to the matrix obtained in step 3.
5.Rewrite each nonzero equation from step 4 so that its one basic variable is
expressed in terms of any free variables appearing in the equation.

This echelon matrix shows that the system is inconsistent , because its rightmost
column is a pivot column; the third row corresponds to the equation 0 = 5. There
is no need to perform any more row operations. Note that the presence of the free
variables in this problem is irrelevant because the system is inconsistent.
3.Since the coefﬁcient matrix has four pivots, there is a pivot in every row of the
coefﬁcient matrix. This means that when the coefﬁcient matrix is row reduced, it
willnothave a row of zeros, thus the corresponding row reduced augmented matrix
can never have a row of the form [ 0 0  0 b], where bis a nonzero number. By
Theorem 2, the system is consistent. Moreover, since there are seven columns in
the coefﬁcient matrix and only four pivot columns, there will be three free variables
resulting in inﬁnitely many solutions.
1.3 VECTOR EQUATIONS
Important properties of linear systems can be described with the concept and notation
of vectors. This section connects equations involving vectors to ordinary systems of
equations. The term vector appears in a variety of mathematical and physical contexts,
which we will discuss in Chapter 4, “Vector Spaces.” Until then, vector will mean an
ordered list of numbers . This simple idea enables us to get to interesting and important
applications as quickly as possible.
Vectors in R2
A matrix with only one column is called a column vector , or simply a vector . Examples
of vectors with two entries are
uD3
 1
; vD:2
:3
; wDw1
w2
where w1andw2are any real numbers. The set of all vectors with two entries is denoted
byR2(read “r-two”). The Rstands for the real numbers that appear as entries in the
vectors, and the exponent 2 indicates that each vector contains two entries.1
Two vectors in R2areequal if and only if their corresponding entries are equal.
Thus4
7
and7
4
arenotequal, because vectors in R2areordered pairs of real
numbers.
1Most of the text concerns vectors and matrices that have only real entries. However, all deﬁnitions and
theorems in Chapters 1–5, and in most of the rest of the text, remain valid if the entries are complex
numbers. Complex vectors and matrices arise naturally, for example, in electrical engineering and physics.

is determined by an ordered pair of numbers, we can identify a geometric point .a; b/
with the column vectora
b
. So we may regard R2as the set of all points in the plane.

The geometric visualization of a vector such as3
 1
is often aided by including an
arrow (directed line segment) from the origin .0; 0/ to the point .3; 1/, as in Figure 2.
In this case, the individual points along the arrow itself have no special signiﬁcance.2
The sum of two vectors has a useful geometric representation. The following rule
can be veriﬁed by analytic geometry.
Parallelogram Rule for Addition
IfuandvinR2are represented as points in the plane, then uCvcorresponds to
the fourth vertex of the parallelogram whose other vertices are u,0, and v. See
Figure 3.

length of the arrow for u. [Recall that the length of the line segment from .0; 0/ to.a; b/

vectors will be discussed in Section 4.1.

The vector whose entries are all zero is called the zero vector and is denoted by 0.
(The number of entries in 0will be clear from the context.)
Equality of vectors in Rnand the operations of scalar multiplication and vector
addition in Rnare deﬁned entry by entry just as in R2. These operations on vectors
have the following properties, which can be veriﬁed directly from the corresponding
properties for real numbers. See Practice Problem 1 and Exercises 33 and 34 at the end
of this section.

Linear Combinations
Given vectors v1;v2; : : : ; vpinRnand given scalars c1; c2; : : : ; c p, the vector ydeﬁned
by
yDc1v1C    C cpvp
is called a linear combination ofv1; : : : ; vpwith weights c1; : : : ; c p. Property (ii) above
permits us to omit parentheses when forming such a linear combination. The weights in
a linear combination can be any real numbers, including zero. For example, some linear
combinations of vectors v1andv2arep

SOLUTION The parallelogram rule shows that uis the sum of 3v1and 2v2; that is,

This expression for ucan be interpreted as instructions for traveling from the origin to u
along two straight paths. First, travel 3 units in the v1direction to 3v1, and then travel  2
units in the v2direction (parallel to the line through v2and0). Next, although the vector
wis not on a grid line, wappears to be about halfway between two pairs of grid lines,
at the vertex of a parallelogram determined by .5=2/ v1and. 1=2/ v2. (See Figure 9.)

For brevity, write this matrix in a way that identiﬁes its columns—namely,

It is clear how to write this augmented matrix immediately from vector equation (1),
without going through the intermediate steps of Example 5. Take the vectors in the
order in which they appear in (1) and put them into the columns of a matrix as in (4).
The discussion above is easily modiﬁed to establish the following fundamental fact.

A vector equation
x1a1Cx2a2C    C xnanDb
has the same solution set as the linear system whose augmented matrix is
a1 a2   an b
(5)
In particular, bcan be generated by a linear combination of a1; : : : ; anif and only
if there exists a solution to the linear system corresponding to the matrix (5).
One of the key ideas in linear algebra is to study the set of all vectors that can be
generated or written as a linear combination of a ﬁxed set fv1; : : : ; vpgof vectors.
D E F I N I T I O N Ifv1; : : : ; vpare inRn, then the set of all linear combinations of v1; : : : ; vp
is denoted by Span fv1; : : : ; vpgand is called the subset of Rnspanned (or
generated )by v 1; : : : ; vp. That is, Span fv1; : : : ; vpgis the collection of all vectors
that can be written in the form
c1v1Cc2v2C    C cpvp
withc1; : : : ; c pscalars.
Asking whether a vector bis in Span fv1; : : : ; vpgamounts to asking whether the
vector equation
x1v1Cx2v2C    C xpvpDb
has a solution, or, equivalently, asking whether the linear system with augmented matrix
v1   vpbhas a solution.
Note that Span fv1; : : : ; vpgcontains every scalar multiple of v1(for exam-
ple), since cv1Dcv1C0v2C    C 0vp. In particular, the zero vector must be in
Spanfv1; : : : ; vpg.
A Geometric Description of Span fvgand Span fu,vg
Letvbe a nonzero vector in R3. Then Span fvgis the set of all scalar multiples of v,
which is the set of points on the line in R3through vand0. See Figure 10.
Ifuandvare nonzero vectors in R3, with vnot a multiple of u, then Span fu;vgis
the plane in R3that contains u,v, and 0. In particular, Span fu;vgcontains the line in
R3through uand0and the line through vand0. See Figure 11.

Linear Combinations in Applications
The ﬁnal example shows how scalar multiples and linear combinations can arise when
a quantity such as “cost” is broken down into several categories. The basic principle for
the example concerns the cost of producing several units of an item when the cost per
unit is known:number
of units
cost
per unit

EXAMPLE 7 A company manufactures two products. For $1.00 worth of product
B, the company spends $.45 on materials, $.25 on labor, and $.15 on overhead. For $1.00
worth of product C, the company spends $.40 on materials, $.30 on labor, and $.15 on
overhead. Let

b.The costs of manufacturing x1dollars worth of B are given by the vector x1b, and
the costs of manufacturing x2dollars worth of C are given by x2c. Hence the total

1.4 THE MATRIX EQUATION Ax=b
A fundamental idea in linear algebra is to view a linear combination of vectors as the
product of a matrix and a vector. The following deﬁnition permits us to rephrase some
of the concepts of Section 1.3 in new ways.
D E F I N I T I O N IfAis an mnmatrix, with columns a1; : : : ; an, and if xis inRn, then the
product of Aand x , denoted by Ax, isthe linear combination of the columns

Equation (3) has the form AxDb. Such an equation is called a matrix equation ,
to distinguish it from a vector equation such as is shown in (2).
Notice how the matrix in (3) is just the matrix of coefﬁcients of the system (1).
Similar calculations show that any system of linear equations, or any vector equation
such as (2), can be written as an equivalent matrix equation in the form AxDb. This
simple observation will be used repeatedly throughout the text.
Here is the formal result.
T H E O R E M 3 IfAis an mnmatrix, with columns a1; : : : ; an, and if bis inRm, the matrix
equation
AxDb (4)
has the same solution set as the vector equation

which, in turn, has the same solution set as the system of linear equations whose
augmented matrix isa1a2   anb

Theorem 3 provides a powerful tool for gaining insight into problems in linear
algebra, because a system of linear equations may now be viewed in three different
but equivalent ways: as a matrix equation, as a vector equation, or as a system of linear
equations. Whenever you construct a mathematical model of a problem in real life, you
are free to choose whichever viewpoint is most natural. Then you may switch from one
formulation of a problem to another whenever it is convenient. In any case, the matrix
equation (4), the vector equation (5), and the system of equations are all solved in the
same way—by row reducing the augmented matrix (6). Other methods of solution will
be discussed later.

1.4The Matrix Equation AxDb37
Existence of Solutions
The deﬁnition of Axleads directly to the following useful fact.
The equation AxDbhas a solution if and only if bis a linear combination of the
columns of A.
Section 1.3 considered the existence question, “Is bin Span fa1; : : : ; ang?” Equiva-
lently, “Is AxDbconsistent?” A harder existence problem is to determine whether the
equation AxDbis consistent for all possible b.

equation AxDbisconsistent: The entries in bmust satisfy
b1 1
2b2Cb3D0
This is the equation of a plane through the origin in R3. The plane is the set of all linear
combinations of the three columns of A. See Figure 1.
The equation AxDbin Example 3 fails to be consistent for all bbecause the
echelon form of Ahas a row of zeros. If Ahad a pivot in all three rows, we would
not care about the calculations in the augmented column because in this case an echelon
form of the augmented matrix could not have a row such as 0 0 0 1 .
In the next theorem, the sentence “The columns of AspanRm” means that every bin

Theorem 4 is one of the most useful theorems in this chapter. Statements (a), (b), and
(c) are equivalent because of the deﬁnition of Axand what it means for a set of vectors
to span Rm. The discussion after Example 3 suggests why (a) and (d) are equivalent;
a proof is given at the end of the section. The exercises will provide examples of how
Theorem 4 is used.
Warning: Theorem 4 is about a coefﬁcient matrix , not an augmented matrix. If an
augmented matrix Abhas a pivot position in every row, then the equation AxDb
may or may not be consistent.
Computation of Ax
The calculations in Example 1 were based on the deﬁnition of the product of a matrix A
and a vector x. The following simple example will lead to a more efﬁcient method for
calculating the entries in Axwhen working problems by hand.

This matrix shows how to compute the ﬁrst entry in Axdirectly, without writing down
all the calculations shown in (7). Similarly, the second entry in Axcan be calculated at

xand then summing the resulting products:

inx.

corresponding entries from row iofAand from the vector x.

To optimize a computer algorithm to compute Ax, the sequence of calculations
should involve data stored in contiguous memory locations. The most widely
used professional algorithms for matrix computations are written in Fortran, a
language that stores a matrix as a set of columns. Such algorithms compute Axas
a linear combination of the columns of A. In contrast, if a program is written in
the popular language C, which stores matrices by rows, Axshould be computed
via the alternative rule that uses the rows of A.
PROOF OF THEOREM 4 As was pointed out after Theorem 4, statements (a), (b), and
(c) are logically equivalent. So, it sufﬁces to show (for an arbitrary matrix A) that (a)
and (d) are either both true or both false. This will tie all four statements together.
LetUbe an echelon form of A. Given binRm, we can row reduce the augmented
matrix Abto an augmented matrix Udfor some dinRm:
Ab     Ud
If statement (d) is true, then each row of Ucontains a pivot position and there can be no
pivot in the augmented column. So AxDbhas a solution for any b, and (a) is true. If (d)
is false, the last row of Uis all zeros. Let dbe any vector with a 1 in its last entry. Then
Udrepresents an inconsistent system. Since row operations are reversible, Ud
can be transformed into the form Ab. The new system AxDbis also inconsistent,
and (a) is false.

1.5 SOLUTION SETS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS
Solution sets of linear systems are important objects of study in linear algebra. They
will appear later in several different contexts. This section uses vector notation to give
explicit and geometric descriptions of such solution sets.
Homogeneous Linear Systems
A system of linear equations is said to be homogeneous if it can be written in the form
AxD0, where Ais an mnmatrix and 0is the zero vector in Rm. Such a system
AxD0always has at least one solution, namely, xD0(the zero vector in Rn/. This

--- Page 61 ---
44 CHAPTER 1 Linear Equations in Linear Algebra
zero solution is usually called the trivial solution . For a given equation AxD0;the
important question is whether there exists a nontrivial solution , that is, a nonzero
vector xthat satisﬁes AxD0:The Existence and Uniqueness Theorem in Section 1.2
(Theorem 2) leads immediately to the following fact.
The homogeneous equation AxD0has a nontrivial solution if and only if the
equation has at least one free variable.
EXAMPLE 1 Determine if the following homogeneous system has a nontrivial
solution. Then describe the solution set.
3x1C5x2 4x3D0
 3x1 2x2C4x3D0
6x1Cx2 8x3D0
SOLUTION LetAbe the matrix of coefﬁcients of the system and row reduce the
augmented matrix A0to echelon form:

52
43 5  4 0
0 3 0 0
0 0 0 03
5
Since x3is a free variable, AxD0has nontrivial solutions (one for each choice of x3).
To describe the solution set, continue the row reduction of A0toreduced echelon
form:

0 0 0 03
5x1 4
3x3D0
x2 D0

Solve for the basic variables x1andx2and obtain x1D4
3x3,x2D0, with x3free. As a
vector, the general solution of AxD0has the form

Here x3is factored out of the expression for the general solution vector. This shows that
every solution of AxD0in this case is a scalar multiple of v. The trivial solution is
obtained by choosing x3D0:Geometrically, the solution set is a line through 0inR3.
See Figure 1.

This calculation shows that every solution of (1) is a linear combination of the vectors
uandv, shown in (2). That is, the solution set is Span fu;vg. Since neither unorvis a
scalar multiple of the other, the solution set is a plane through the origin. See Figure 2.
uvx1x3
x2 FIGURE 2
Examples 1 and 2, along with the exercises, illustrate the fact that the solution
set of a homogeneous equation AxD0can always be expressed explicitly as
Spanfv1; : : : ; vpgfor suitable vectors v1; : : : ; vp. If the only solution is the zero vector,
then the solution set is Span f0g. If the equation AxD0has only one free variable, the
solution set is a line through the origin, as in Figure 1. A plane through the origin, as in
Figure 2, provides a good mental image for the solution set of AxD0when there are
two or more free variables. Note, however, that a similar ﬁgure can be used to visualize
Spanfu;vgeven when uandvdo not arise as solutions of AxD0:See Figure 11 in
Section 1.3.
Parametric Vector Form
The original equation (1) for the plane in Example 2 is an implicit description of the
plane. Solving this equation amounts to ﬁnding an explicit description of the plane as
the set spanned by uandv. Equation (2) is called a parametric vector equation of the
plane. Sometimes such an equation is written as
xDsuCtv.s; t inR/
to emphasize that the parameters vary over all real numbers. In Example 1, the equation
xDx3v(with x3free), or xDtv(with tinR), is a parametric vector equation of a line.
Whenever a solution set is described explicitly with vectors as in Examples 1 and 2, we
say that the solution is in parametric vector form .
Solutions of Nonhomogeneous Systems
When a nonhomogeneous linear system has many solutions, the general solution can be
written in parametric vector form as one vector plus an arbitrary linear combination of
vectors that satisfy the corresponding homogeneous system.

The equation xDpCx3v, or, writing tas a general parameter,

describes the solution set of AxDbin parametric vector form. Recall from Example 1
that the solution set of AxD0has the parametric vector equation
xDtv(tinR) (4)
[with the same vthat appears in (3)]. Thus the solutions of AxDbare obtained by
adding the vector pto the solutions of AxD0. The vector pitself is just one particular
solution of AxDb[corresponding to tD0in (3)].

Adding ptovtranslates vtovCp.
To describe the solution set of AxDbgeometrically, we can think of vector
addition as a translation . Given vandpinR2orR3, the effect of adding ptovis

vector p, the result is a line parallel to L. See Figure 4.
Suppose Lis the line through 0andv, described by equation (4). Adding pto each
point on Lproduces the translated line described by equation (3). Note that pis on the
line in equation (3). We call (3) the equation of the line through p parallel to v . Thus
the solution set of AxDbis a line through pparallel to the solution set of AxD0.
Figure 5 illustrates this case.

The relation between the solution sets of AxDbandAxD0shown in Figure 5
generalizes to any consistent equation AxDb, although the solution set will be larger
than a line when there are several free variables. The following theorem gives the precise
statement. See Exercise 25 for a proof.

T H E O R E M 6 Suppose the equation AxDbis consistent for some given b, and let pbe a
solution. Then the solution set of AxDbis the set of all vectors of the form
wDpCvh, where vhis any solution of the homogeneous equation AxD0.
Theorem 6 says that if AxDbhas a solution, then the solution set is obtained by
translating the solution set of AxD0, using any particular solution pofAxDbfor
the translation. Figure 6 illustrates the case in which there are two free variables. Even
when n > 3 , our mental image of the solution set of a consistent system AxDb(with
b¤0) is either a single nonzero point or a line or plane not passing through the origin.

1.6 APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR SYSTEMS
You might expect that a real-life problem involving linear algebra would have only
one solution, or perhaps no solution. The purpose of this section is to show how linear
systems with many solutions can arise naturally. The applications here come from
economics, chemistry, and network ﬂow.
A Homogeneous System in Economics
The system of 500 equations in 500 variables, mentioned in this chapter’s introduction,
WEB
is now known as a Leontief “input–output” (or “production”) model.1Section 2.6 will
examine this model in more detail, when more theory and better notation are available.
For now, we look at a simpler “exchange model,” also due to Leontief.
Suppose a nation’s economy is divided into many sectors, such as various manufac-
turing, communication, entertainment, and service industries. Suppose that for each sec-
tor we know its total output for one year and we know exactly how this output is divided
or “exchanged” among the other sectors of the economy. Let the total dollar value of a
sector’s output be called the price of that output. Leontief proved the following result.
There exist equilibrium prices that can be assigned to the total outputs of the
various sectors in such a way that the income of each sector exactly balances its
expenses.
The following example shows how to ﬁnd the equilibrium prices.
EXAMPLE 1 Suppose an economy consists of the Coal, Electric (power), and Steel
sectors, and the output of each sector is distributed among the various sectors as shown
in Table 1, where the entries in a column represent the fractional parts of a sector’s total
output.
The second column of Table 1, for instance, says that the total output of the
Electric sector is divided as follows: 40% to Coal, 50% to Steel, and the remaining
10% to Electric. (Electric treats this 10% as an expense it incurs in order to operate its
1See Wassily W. Leontief, “Input–Output Economics,” Scientiﬁc American , October 1951, pp. 15–21.

business.) Since all output must be taken into account, the decimal fractions in each
column must sum to 1.
Denote the prices (i.e., dollar values) of the total annual outputs of the Coal,
Electric, and Steel sectors by pC,pE, and pS, respectively. If possible, ﬁnd equilibrium
prices that make each sector’s income match its expenditures.

TABLE 1 A Simple Economy
Distribution of Output from:
Coal Electric Steel Purchased by:
.0 .4 .6 Coal
.6 .1 .2 Electric
.4 .5 .2 Steel
SOLUTION A sector looks down a column to see where its output goes, and it looks
across a row to see what it needs as inputs. For instance, the ﬁrst row of Table 1 says
that Coal receives (and pays for) 40% of the Electric output and 60% of the Steel
output. Since the respective values of the total outputs are pEandpS, Coal must spend
:4p Edollars for its share of Electric’s output and :6p Sfor its share of Steel’s output.
Thus Coal’s total expenses are :4p EC:6p S. To make Coal’s income, pC, equal to its
expenses, we want
pCD:4p EC:6p S (1)
The second row of the exchange table shows that the Electric sector spends :6p C
for coal, :1p Efor electricity, and :2p Sfor steel. Hence the income/expense requirement
for Electric is
pED:6p CC:1p EC:2p S (2)
Finally, the third row of the exchange table leads to the ﬁnal requirement:
pSD:4p CC:5p EC:2p S (3)
To solve the system of equations (1), (2), and (3), move all the unknowns to the left
sides of the equations and combine like terms. [For instance, on the left side of (2),
write pE :1p Eas:9p E.]
pC :4p E :6p SD0
 :6p CC:9p E :2p SD0
 :4p C :5p EC:8p SD0

Any (nonnegative) choice for pSresults in a choice of equilibrium prices. For instance,
if we take pSto be 100 (or $100 million), then pCD94andpED85. The incomes and
expenditures of each sector will be equal if the output of Coal is priced at $94 million,
that of Electric at $85 million, and that of Steel at $100 million.
Balancing Chemical Equations
Chemical equations describe the quantities of substances consumed and produced by
chemical reactions. For instance, when propane gas burns, the propane (C 3H8) combines
with oxygen (O 2) to form carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water (H 2O), according to an
equation of the form
.x1/C3H8C.x2/O2!.x3/CO2C.x4/H2O (4)
To “balance” this equation, a chemist must ﬁnd whole numbers x1; : : : ; x 4such that the
total numbers of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms on the left match the
corresponding numbers of atoms on the right (because atoms are neither destroyed nor
created in the reaction).
A systematic method for balancing chemical equations is to set up a vector equation
that describes the numbers of atoms of each type present in a reaction. Since equation
(4) involves three types of atoms (carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen), construct a vector in
R3for each reactant and product in (4) that lists the numbers of “atoms per molecule,”
as follows:
C3H8W2

Since the coefﬁcients in a chemical equation must be integers, take x4D4, in which
casex1D1,x2D5, and x3D3. The balanced equation is
C3H8C5O2!3CO2C4H2O
The equation would also be balanced if, for example, each coefﬁcient were doubled. For
most purposes, however, chemists prefer to use a balanced equation whose coefﬁcients
are the smallest possible whole numbers.

Network Flow
Systems of linear equations arise naturally when scientists, engineers, or economists
WEB
study the ﬂow of some quantity through a network. For instance, urban planners and
trafﬁc engineers monitor the pattern of trafﬁc ﬂow in a grid of city streets. Electrical
engineers calculate current ﬂow through electrical circuits. And economists analyze the
distribution of products from manufacturers to consumers through a network of whole-
salers and retailers. For many networks, the systems of equations involve hundreds or
even thousands of variables and equations.
Anetwork consists of a set of points called junctions , ornodes , with lines or arcs
called branches connecting some or all of the junctions. The direction of ﬂow in each
branch is indicated, and the ﬂow amount (or rate) is either shown or is denoted by a
variable.
The basic assumption of network ﬂow is that the total ﬂow into the network equals
the total ﬂow out of the network and that the total ﬂow into a junction equals the total
ﬂow out of the junction. For example, Figure 1 shows 30 units ﬂowing into a junction
through one branch, with x1andx2denoting the ﬂows out of the junction through other
branches. Since the ﬂow is “conserved” at each junction, we must have x1Cx2D30.
In a similar fashion, the ﬂow at each junction is described by a linear equation. The
problem of network analysis is to determine the ﬂow in each branch when partial
information (such as the ﬂow into and out of the network) is known.

Also, the total ﬂow into the network .500C300C100C400/ equals the total ﬂow
out of the network .300Cx3C600/, which simpliﬁes to x3D400. Combine this
equation with a rearrangement of the ﬁrst four equations to obtain the following system
of equations:
x1Cx2 D800

A negative ﬂow in a network branch corresponds to ﬂow in the direction opposite
to that shown on the model. Since the streets in this problem are one-way, none of the
variables here can be negative. This fact leads to certain limitations on the possible
values of the variables. For instance, x5500because x4cannot be negative. Other
constraints on the variables are considered in Practice Problem 2.
PRACTICE PROBLEMS
1.Suppose an economy has three sectors: Agriculture, Mining, and Manufacturing.
Agriculture sells 5% of its output to Mining and 30% to Manufacturing, and retains
the rest. Mining sells 20% of its output to Agriculture and 70% to Manufacturing,
and retains the rest. Manufacturing sells 20% of its output to Agriculture and 30% to
Mining, and retains the rest. Determine the exchange table for this economy, where
the columns describe how the output of each sector is exchanged among the three
sectors.

a.We must determine if there is a nontrivial solution of equation (1) above. Row oper-
ations on the associated augmented matrix show that2

Clearly, x1andx2are basic variables, and x3is free. Each nonzero value of x3
determines a nontrivial solution of (1). Hence v1;v2;v3are linearly dependent (and
not linearly independent).
b.To ﬁnd a linear dependence relation among v1,v2, and v3, completely row reduce
the augmented matrix and write the new system:

Thus x1D2x3,x2D  x3, and x3is free. Choose any nonzero value for x3—say,
x3D5. Then x1D10andx2D  5. Substitute these values into equation (1) and
obtain

This is one (out of inﬁnitely many) possible linear dependence relations among v1,
v2, and v3.

Linear Independence of Matrix Columns
Suppose that we begin with a matrix ADa1   aninstead of a set of vectors. The
matrix equation AxD0can be written as
x1a1Cx2a2C    C xnanD0
Each linear dependence relation among the columns of Acorresponds to a nontrivial
solution of AxD0. Thus we have the following important fact.
The columns of a matrix Aare linearly independent if and only if the equation
AxD0hasonly the trivial solution. (3)
EXAMPLE 2 Determine if the columns of the matrix AD2
40 1 4
1 2  1

linearly independent.
SOLUTION To study AxD0, row reduce the augmented matrix:

5 8 0 03

52
41 2  1 0
0 1 4 0
0 0 13 03

At this point, it is clear that there are three basic variables and no free variables. So
the equation AxD0has only the trivial solution, and the columns of Aare linearly
independent.
Sets of One or Two Vectors
A set containing only one vector—say, v—is linearly independent if and only if vis not
the zero vector. This is because the vector equation x1vD0has only the trivial solution
when v¤0. The zero vector is linearly dependent because x10D0has many nontrivial
solutions.
The next example will explain the nature of a linearly dependent set of two vectors.

b.The vectors v1andv2are certainly notmultiples of one another. Could they be

Ifc¤0, then we can solve for v1in terms of v2, namely, v1D. d=c/ v2. This result
is impossible because v1isnota multiple of v2. Socmust be zero. Similarly, dmust
also be zero. Thus fv1;v2gis a linearly independent set.

FIGURE 1set of two vectors is linearly dependent. Row operations are unnecessary. Simply check
whether at least one of the vectors is a scalar times the other. (The test applies only to
sets of twovectors.)
A set of two vectors fv1;v2gis linearly dependent if at least one of the vectors is
a multiple of the other. The set is linearly independent if and only if neither of the
vectors is a multiple of the other.
In geometric terms, two vectors are linearly dependent if and only if they lie on the
same line through the origin. Figure 1 shows the vectors from Example 3.
Sets of Two or More Vectors
The proof of the next theorem is similar to the solution of Example 3. Details are given
at the end of this section.
T H E O R E M 7 Characterization of Linearly Dependent Sets
An indexed set SD fv1; : : : ; vpgof two or more vectors is linearly dependent if
and only if at least one of the vectors in Sis a linear combination of the others. In
fact, if Sis linearly dependent and v1¤0, then some vj(with j > 1 ) is a linear
combination of the preceding vectors, v1; : : : ; vj 1.
Warning: Theorem 7 does notsay that every vector in a linearly dependent set is a
linear combination of the preceding vectors. A vector in a linearly dependent set may
fail to be a linear combination of the other vectors. See Practice Problem 1(c).

Spanfu;vgis the x1x2-plane (with x3D0/. Ifwis a linear combination of uandv,
thenfu;v;wgis linearly dependent, by Theorem 7. Conversely, suppose that fu;v;wg

Example 4 generalizes to any set fu;v;wginR3with uandvlinearly independent.
The set fu;v;wgwill be linearly dependent if and only if wis in the plane spanned by
uandv.
The next two theorems describe special cases in which the linear dependence of a
set is automatic. Moreover, Theorem 8 will be a key result for work in later chapters.
T H E O R E M 8 If a set contains more vectors than there are entries in each vector, then the set

p > n .
PROOF LetADv1   vp. Then Aisnp, and the equation AxD0corre-

and the columns of Aare linearly dependent. See Figure 3 for a matrix version of this
theorem.
Warning: Theorem 8 says nothing about the case in which the number of vectors in
the set does notexceed the number of entries in each vector.
EXAMPLE 5 The vectors2

SOLUTION
a.The set contains four vectors, each of which has only three entries. So the set is
linearly dependent by Theorem 8.
b.Theorem 8 does not apply here because the number of vectors does not exceed the
number of entries in each vector. Since the zero vector is in the set, the set is linearly
dependent by Theorem 9.
c.Compare the corresponding entries of the two vectors. The second vector seems to
be 3=2times the ﬁrst vector. This relation holds for the ﬁrst three pairs of entries,
but fails for the fourth pair. Thus neither of the vectors is a multiple of the other, and
hence they are linearly independent.

1.7Linear Independence 61
In general, you should read a section thoroughly several times to absorb an
SG Mastering: Linear
Independence 1–31 important concept such as linear independence. The notes in the Study Guide for this
section will help you learn to form mental images of key ideas in linear algebra. For
instance, the following proof is worth reading carefully because it shows how the
deﬁnition of linear independence can be used.
PROOF OF THEOREM 7 (Characterization of Linearly Dependent Sets)
If some vjinSequals a linear combination of the other vectors, then vjcan be
subtracted from both sides of the equation, producing a linear dependence relation with
a nonzero weight . 1/onvj. [For instance, if v1Dc2v2Cc3v3, then 0D. 1/v1C
c2v2Cc3v3C0v4C    C 0vp.] Thus Sis linearly dependent.
Conversely, suppose Sis linearly dependent. If v1is zero, then it is a (trivial)
linear combination of the other vectors in S. Otherwise, v1¤0, and there exist weights

SOLUTIONS TO PRACTICE PROBLEMS
1.a.Yes. In each case, neither vector is a multiple of the other. Thus each set is linearly
independent.
b.No. The observation in Part (a), by itself, says nothing about the linear indepen-
dence of fu;v;w;zg.
c.No. When testing for linear independence, it is usually a poor idea to check if
one selected vector is a linear combination of the others. It may happen that
the selected vector is not a linear combination of the others and yet the whole
set of vectors is linearly dependent. In this practice problem, wis not a linear
combination of u,v, and z.

d.Yes, by Theorem 8. There are more vectors (four) than entries (three) in them.
2.Applying the deﬁnition of linearly dependent to fv1;v2;v3gimplies that there exist
scalars c1; c2, and c3, not all zero, such that
c1v1Cc2v2Cc3v3D0:
Adding 0v4D0to both sides of this equation results in
c1v1Cc2v2Cc3v3C0v4D0:
Since c1; c2; c3and 0 are not allzero, the set fv1;v2;v3;v4gsatisﬁes the deﬁnition of
a linearly dependent set.
1.8 INTRODUCTION TO LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
The difference between a matrix equation AxDband the associated vector equation
x1a1C    C xnanDbis merely a matter of notation. However, a matrix equation
AxDbcan arise in linear algebra (and in applications such as computer graphics and
signal processing) in a way that is not directly connected with linear combinations of
vectors. This happens when we think of the matrix Aas an object that “acts” on a vector
xby multiplication to produce a new vector called Ax.

ical systems will be discussed in Sections 1.10, 4.8, and 4.9 and throughout Chapter 5.
Matrix Transformations
The rest of this section focuses on mappings associated with matrix multiplication. For
each xinRn,T .x/is computed as Ax, where Ais an mnmatrix. For simplicity, we
sometimes denote such a matrix transformation byx7!Ax. Observe that the domain of

the dynamic view of a matrix as something that transforms vectors into other vectors.

1.8Introduction to Linear Transformations 67
Linear transformations preserve the operations of vector addition and scalar mul-
tiplication . Property (i) says that the result T .uCv/of ﬁrst adding uandvinRnand
then applying Tis the same as ﬁrst applying Ttouand to vand then adding T .u/and
T .v/inRm. These two properties lead easily to the following useful facts.
IfTis a linear transformation, then
T .0/D0 (3)
and
T .cuCdv/DcT .u/CdT .v/ (4)
for all vectors u,vin the domain of Tand all scalars c; d.
Property (3) follows from condition (ii) in the deﬁnition, because T .0/DT .0u/D
0T .u/D0. Property (4) requires both (i) and (ii):
T .cuCdv/DT .cu/CT .dv/DcT .u/CdT .v/
Observe that if a transformation satisﬁes (4)for all u,vandc; d,it must be linear .
(SetcDdD1for preservation of addition, and set dD0for preservation of scalar
multiplication.) Repeated application of (4) produces a useful generalization:
T .c 1v1C    C cpvp/Dc1T .v1/C    C cpT .vp/ (5)
In engineering and physics, (5) is referred to as a superposition principle . Think
ofv1; : : : ; vpas signals that go into a system and T .v1/; : : : ; T . vp/as the responses of
that system to the signals. The system satisﬁes the superposition principle if whenever
an input is expressed as a linear combination of such signals, the system’s response is
the same linear combination of the responses to the individual signals. We will return to
this idea in Chapter 4.

The ﬁnal example is not geometrical; instead, it shows how a linear mapping can
transform one type of data into another.
EXAMPLE 6 A company manufactures two products, B and C. Using data from
Example 7 in Section 1.3, we construct a “unit cost” matrix, UDb c , whose
columns describe the “costs per dollar of output” for the products:

The mapping Ttransforms a list of production quantities (measured in dollars) into a
list of total costs. The linearity of this mapping is reﬂected in two ways:
1.If production is increased by a factor of, say, 4, from xto4x, then the costs will
increase by the same factor, from T .x/to4T .x/.

transformation from RntoRmis actually a matrix transformation x7!Axand that
important properties of Tare intimately related to familiar properties of A. The key to

We know now that every linear transformation from RntoRmcan be viewed as
a matrix transformation, and vice versa. The term linear transformation focuses on a
property of a mapping, while matrix transformation describes how such a mapping is
implemented, as Examples 2 and 3 illustrate.

Geometric Linear Transformations of R2
Examples 2 and 3 illustrate linear transformations that are described geometrically.
Tables 1–4 illustrate other common geometric linear transformations of the plane.
Because the transformations are linear, they are determined completely by what they
do to the columns of I2. Instead of showing only the images of e1ande2, the tables
show what a transformation does to the unit square (Figure 2).
Other transformations can be constructed from those listed in Tables 1–4 by
applying one transformation after another. For instance, a horizontal shear could be
followed by a reﬂection in the x2-axis. Section 2.1 will show that such a composition of
linear transformations is linear. (Also, see Exercise 36.)

Does TmapR4ontoR3? IsTa one-to-one mapping?
SOLUTION Since Ahappens to be in echelon form, we can see at once that Ahas a
pivot position in each row. By Theorem 4 in Section 1.4, for each binR3, the equation
AxDbis consistent. In other words, the linear transformation TmapsR4(its domain)
ontoR3. However, since the equation AxDbhas a free variable (because there are four
variables and only three basic variables), each bis the image of more than one x. That
is,Tisnotone-to-one.
T H E O R E M 1 1 LetTWRn!Rmbe a linear transformation. Then Tis one-to-one if and only if
the equation T .x/D0has only the trivial solution.
Remark: To prove a theorem that says “statement Pis true if and only if statement Qis
true,” one must establish two things: (1) If Pis true, then Qis true and (2) If Qis true,
thenPis true. The second requirement can also be established by showing (2a): If Pis
false, then Qis false. (This is called contrapositive reasoning.) This proof uses (1) and
(2a) to show that PandQare either both true or both false.
PROOF Since Tis linear, T .0/D0. IfTis one-to-one, then the equation T .x/D0
has at most one solution and hence only the trivial solution. If Tis not one-to-one, then
there is a bthat is the image of at least two different vectors in Rn—say, uandv. That
is,T .u/DbandT .v/Db. But then, since Tis linear,
T .u v/DT .u/ T .v/Db bD0
The vector u vis not zero, since u¤v. Hence the equation T .x/D0has more than
one solution. So, either the two conditions in the theorem are both true or they are both
false.

T H E O R E M 1 2 LetTWRn!Rmbe a linear transformation, and let Abe the standard matrix for
T. Then:
a.TmapsRnontoRmif and only if the columns of AspanRm;
b.Tis one-to-one if and only if the columns of Aare linearly independent.
Remark: “If and only if” statements can be linked together. For example if “ Pif and
only if Q” is known and “ Qif and only if R” is known, then one can conclude “ Pif
and only if R.” This strategy is used repeatedly in this proof.
PROOF
a.By Theorem 4 in Section 1.4, the columns of AspanRmif and only if for each b
inRmthe equation AxDbis consistent—in other words, if and only if for every b,
the equation T .x/Dbhas at least one solution. This is true if and only if Tmaps
RnontoRm.
b.The equations T .x/D0andAxD0are the same except for notation. So, by
Theorem 11, Tis one-to-one if and only if AxD0has only the trivial solution. This
happens if and only if the columns of Aare linearly independent, as was already
noted in the boxed statement (3) in Section 1.7.
Statement (a) in Theorem 12 is equivalent to the statement “ TmapsRnontoRm
if and only if every vector in Rmis a linear combination of the columns of A.” See
Theorem 4 in Section 1.4.
In the next example and in some exercises that follow, column vectors are written in
rows, such as xD.x1; x2/, and T .x/is written as T .x 1; x2/instead of the more formal
T ..x 1; x2//.

SoTis indeed a linear transformation, with its standard matrix Ashown in (4). The
columns of Aare linearly independent because they are not multiples. By Theorem
12(b), Tis one-to-one. To decide if Tis onto R3, examine the span of the columns of
A. Since Ais32, the columns of AspanR3if and only if Ahas 3 pivot positions, by
Theorem 4. This is impossible, since Ahas only 2 columns. So the columns of Ado not

1.10 LINEAR MODELS IN BUSINESS, SCIENCE, AND ENGINEERING
The mathematical models in this section are all linear ; that is, each describes a
problem by means of a linear equation, usually in vector or matrix form. The ﬁrst
model concerns nutrition but actually is representative of a general technique in linear
programming problems. The second model comes from electrical engineering. The third
model introduces the concept of a linear difference equation , a powerful mathematical
tool for studying dynamic processes in a wide variety of ﬁelds such as engineering,
ecology, economics, telecommunications, and the management sciences. Linear models
are important because natural phenomena are often linear or nearly linear when the
variables involved are held within reasonable bounds. Also, linear models are more
easily adapted for computer calculation than are complex nonlinear models.
As you read about each model, pay attention to how its linearity reﬂects some
property of the system being modeled.
Constructing a Nutritious Weight-Loss Diet
The formula for the Cambridge Diet, a popular diet in the 1980s, was based on years
WEB
of research. A team of scientists headed by Dr. Alan H. Howard developed this diet
at Cambridge University after more than eight years of clinical work with obese
patients.1The very low-calorie powdered formula diet combines a precise balance
of carbohydrate, high-quality protein, and fat, together with vitamins, minerals, trace
elements, and electrolytes. Millions of persons have used the diet to achieve rapid and
substantial weight loss.
To achieve the desired amounts and proportions of nutrients, Dr. Howard had to
incorporate a large variety of foodstuffs in the diet. Each foodstuff supplied several of
the required ingredients, but not in the correct proportions. For instance, nonfat milk was
a major source of protein but contained too much calcium. So soy ﬂour was used for
part of the protein because soy ﬂour contains little calcium. However, soy ﬂour contains
proportionally too much fat, so whey was added since it supplies less fat in relation to
calcium. Unfortunately, whey contains too much carbohydrate : : : :
The following example illustrates the problem on a small scale. Listed in Table 1
are three of the ingredients in the diet, together with the amounts of certain nutrients
supplied by 100 grams (g) of each ingredient.2

(1978) 2, 321–332.

EXAMPLE 1 If possible, ﬁnd some combination of nonfat milk, soy ﬂour, and whey
to provide the exact amounts of protein, carbohydrate, and fat supplied by the diet in
one day (Table 1).
SOLUTION Letx1,x2, and x3, respectively, denote the number of units (100 g) of
these foodstuffs. One approach to the problem is to derive equations for each nutrient
separately. For instance, the product
x1units of
nonfat milk
protein per unit
of nonfat milk
gives the amount of protein supplied by x1units of nonfat milk. To this amount, we
would then add similar products for soy ﬂour and whey and set the resulting sum equal
to the amount of protein we need. Analogous calculations would have to be made for
each nutrient.
A more efﬁcient method, and one that is conceptually simpler, is to consider a
“nutrient vector” for each foodstuff and build just one vector equation. The amount
of nutrients supplied by x1units of nonfat milk is the scalar multiple

where a1is the ﬁrst column in Table 1. Let a2anda3be the corresponding vectors for
soy ﬂour and whey, respectively, and let bbe the vector that lists the total nutrients
required (the last column of the table). Then x2a2andx3a3give the nutrients supplied
byx2units of soy ﬂour and x3units of whey, respectively. So the relevant equation is

To three signiﬁcant digits, the diet requires .277 units of nonfat milk, .392 units of
soy ﬂour, and .233 units of whey in order to provide the desired amounts of protein,
carbohydrate, and fat.
It is important that the values of x1,x2, and x3found above are nonnegative. This is
necessary for the solution to be physically feasible. (How could you use  :233 units of
whey, for instance?) With a large number of nutrient requirements, it may be necessary
to use a larger number of foodstuffs in order to produce a system of equations with
a “nonnegative” solution. Thus many, many different combinations of foodstuffs may
need to be examined in order to ﬁnd a system of equations with such a solution. In
fact, the manufacturer of the Cambridge Diet was able to supply 31 nutrients in precise
amounts using only 33 ingredients.

The diet construction problem leads to the linear equation (2) because the amount
of nutrients supplied by each foodstuff can be written as a scalar multiple of a vector,
as in (1). That is, the nutrients supplied by a foodstuff are proportional to the amount of
the foodstuff added to the diet mixture. Also, each nutrient in the mixture is the sumof
the amounts from the various foodstuffs.
Problems of formulating specialized diets for humans and livestock occur fre-
quently. Usually they are treated by linear programming techniques. Our method of
constructing vector equations often simpliﬁes the task of formulating such problems.
Linear Equations and Electrical Networks
Current ﬂow in a simple electrical network can be described by a system of linear
WEB
equations. A voltage source such as a battery forces a current of electrons to ﬂow through
the network. When the current passes through a resistor (such as a lightbulb or motor),
some of the voltage is “used up”; by Ohm’s law, this “voltage drop” across a resistor is
given by
VDRI
where the voltage Vis measured in volts , the resistance Rinohms (denoted by ), and
the current ﬂow Iinamperes (amps , for short).
The network in Figure 1 contains three closed loops. The currents ﬂowing in loops
1, 2, and 3 are denoted by I1; I2, and I3, respectively. The designated directions of such
loop currents are arbitrary. If a current turns out to be negative, then the actual direction
of current ﬂow is opposite to that chosen in the ﬁgure. If the current direction shown is
away from the positive (longer) side of a battery ( ) around to the negative (shorter)
side, the voltage is positive; otherwise, the voltage is negative.
Current ﬂow in a loop is governed by the following rule.
KIRCHHOFF'S VOLTAGE LAW
The algebraic sum of the RIvoltage drops in one direction around a loop equals
the algebraic sum of the voltage sources in the same direction around the loop.

FIGURE 1SOLUTION For loop 1, the current I1ﬂows through three resistors, and the sum of the
RIvoltage drops is
4I1C4I1C3I1D.4C4C3/I1D11I 1
Current from loop 2 also ﬂows in part of loop 1, through the short branch between A
andB. The associated RIdrop there is 3I2volts. However, the current direction for the
branch ABin loop 1 is opposite to that chosen for the ﬂow in loop 2, so the algebraic
sum of all RIdrops for loop 1 is 11I 1 3I2. Since the voltage in loop 1 is C30volts,
Kirchhoff’s voltage law implies that
11I 1 3I2D30
The equation for loop 2 is
 3I1C6I2 I3D5
The term  3I1comes from the ﬂow of the loop 1 current through the branch AB(with
a negative voltage drop because the current ﬂow there is opposite to the ﬂow in loop 2).
The term 6I2is the sum of all resistances in loop 2, multiplied by the loop current. The

term I3D  1I3comes from the loop 3 current ﬂowing through the 1-ohm resistor
in branch CD, in the direction opposite to the ﬂow in loop 2. The loop 3 equation is
 I2C3I3D  25
Note that the 5-volt battery in branch CDis counted as part of both loop 2 and loop 3,
but it is  5volts for loop 3 because of the direction chosen for the current in loop 3.
The 20-volt battery is negative for the same reason.
The loop currents are found by solving the system
11I 1 3I2 D30
 3I1C6I2 I3D 5
 I2C3I3D  25(3)
Row operations on the augmented matrix lead to the solution: I1D3 amps, I2D1 amp,
andI3D  8amps. The negative value of I3indicates that the actual current in loop 3
ﬂows in the direction opposite to that shown in Figure 1.
It is instructive to look at system (3) as a vector equation:

The ﬁrst entry of each vector concerns the ﬁrst loop, and similarly for the second and
third entries. The ﬁrst resistor vector r1lists the resistance in the various loops through
which current I1ﬂows. A resistance is written negatively when I1ﬂows against the ﬂow
direction in another loop. Examine Figure 1 and see how to compute the entries in r1;
then do the same for r2andr3. The matrix form of equation (4),
RiDv;where RDr1r2r3and iD2

provides a matrix version of Ohm’s law. If all loop currents are chosen in the same direc-
tion (say, counterclockwise), then all entries off the main diagonal of Rwill be negative.
The matrix equation RiDvmakes the linearity of this model easy to see at a
glance. For instance, if the voltage vector is doubled, then the current vector must
double. Also, a superposition principle holds. That is, the solution of equation (4) is
the sum of the solutions of the equations

Each equation here corresponds to the circuit with only one voltage source (the other
sources being replaced by wires that close each loop). The model for current ﬂow is
linear precisely because Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s law are linear: The voltage drop
across a resistor is proportional to the current ﬂowing through it (Ohm), and the sumof
the voltage drops in a loop equals the sum of the voltage sources in the loop (Kirchhoff).
Loop currents in a network can be used to determine the current in any branch of
the network. If only one loop current passes through a branch, such as from BtoD
in Figure 1, the branch current equals the loop current. If more than one loop current
passes through a branch, such as from AtoB, the branch current is the algebraic sum
of the loop currents in the branch ( Kirchhoff’ s current law ). For instance, the current in
branch ABisI1 I2D3 1D2 amps, in the direction of I1. The current in branch
CDisI2 I3D9 amps.

Difference Equations
In many ﬁelds such as ecology, economics, and engineering, a need arises to model
mathematically a dynamic system that changes over time. Several features of the system
are each measured at discrete time intervals, producing a sequence of vectors x0,x1,
x2; : : : : The entries in xkprovide information about the state of the system at the time
of the kth measurement.
If there is a matrix Asuch that x1DAx0,x2DAx1, and, in general,
xkC1DAxkforkD0; 1; 2; : : : (5)
then (5) is called a linear difference equation (orrecurrence relation ). Given such
an equation, one can compute x1,x2, and so on, provided x0is known. Sections 4.8
and 4.9, and several sections in Chapter 5, will develop formulas for xkand describe
what can happen to xkaskincreases indeﬁnitely. The discussion below illustrates how
a difference equation might arise.
A subject of interest to demographers is the movement of populations or groups of
people from one region to another. The simple model here considers the changes in the
population of a certain city and its surrounding suburbs over a period of years.
Fix an initial year—say, 2014—and denote the populations of the city and suburbs
that year by r0ands0, respectively. Let x0be the population vector
x0Dr0

Our goal is to describe mathematically how these vectors might be related.
Suppose demographic studies show that each year about 5% of the city’s population
moves to the suburbs (and 95% remains in the city), while 3% of the suburban population
moves to the city (and 97% remains in the suburbs). See Figure 2.

The model for population movement in (9) is linear because the correspondence
xk7!xkC1is a linear transformation. The linearity depends on two facts: the number
of people who chose to move from one area to another is proportional to the number of
people in that area, as shown in (6) and (7), and the cumulative effect of these choices
is found by adding the movement of people from the different areas.
PRACTICE PROBLEM
Find a matrix Aand vectors xandbsuch that the problem in Example 1 amounts to
solving the equation AxDb.

out of the city/suburban region.

INTRODUCTORY EXAMPLE
Computer Models in Aircraft Design
To design the next generation of commercial and military
aircraft, engineers at Boeing’s Phantom Works use 3D
modeling and computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD). They
study the airﬂow around a virtual airplane to answer
important design questions before physical models are
created. This has drastically reduced design cycle times
and cost—and linear algebra plays a crucial role in the
process.
The virtual airplane begins as a mathematical “wire-
frame” model that exists only in computer memory and
on graphics display terminals. (Model of a Boeing 777 is
shown.) This mathematical model organizes and inﬂuences
each step of the design and manufacture of the airplane—
both the exterior and interior. The CFD analysis concerns
the exterior surface.
Although the ﬁnished skin of a plane may seem
smooth, the geometry of the surface is complicated. In
addition to wings and a fuselage, an aircraft has nacelles,
stabilizers, slats, ﬂaps, and ailerons. The way air ﬂows
around these structures determines how the plane moves
through the sky. Equations that describe the airﬂow are
complicated, and they must account for engine intake,
engine exhaust, and the wakes left by the wings of the
plane. To study the airﬂow, engineers need a highly reﬁned
description of the plane’s surface.
A computer creates a model of the surface by ﬁrst
superimposing a three-dimensional grid of “boxes” on theoriginal wire-frame model. Boxes in this grid lie either
completely inside or completely outside the plane, or they
intersect the surface of the plane. The computer selects
the boxes that intersect the surface and subdivides them,
retaining only the smaller boxes that still intersect the
surface. The subdividing process is repeated until the grid
is extremely ﬁne. A typical grid can include more than
400,000 boxes.
The process for ﬁnding the airﬂow around the plane
involves repeatedly solving a system of linear equations
AxDbthat may involve up to 2 million equations and
variables. The vector bchanges each time, based on data
from the grid and solutions of previous equations. Using
the fastest computers available commercially, a Phantom
Works team can spend from a few hours to several days
setting up and solving a single airﬂow problem. After the
team analyzes the solution, they may make small changes
to the airplane surface and begin the whole process again.
Thousands of CFD runs may be required.
This chapter presents two important concepts that
assist in the solution of such massive systems of equations:
Partitioned matrices: A typical CFD system of
equations has a “sparse” coefﬁcient matrix with
mostly zero entries. Grouping the variables correctly
leads to a partitioned matrix with many zero blocks.
Section 2.4 introduces such matrices and describes
some of their applications.
SECOND REVISED PAGES
93

--- Page 111 ---
94 CHAPTER 2 Matrix Algebra
Matrix factorizations: Even when written with
partitioned matrices, the system of equations is
complicated. To further simplify the computations,
the CFD software at Boeing uses what is called
an LU factorization of the coefﬁcient matrix.
Section 2.5 discusses LU and other useful matrix
factorizations. Further details about factorizations
appear at several points later in the text.
To analyze a solution of an airﬂow system, engineers
want to visualize the airﬂow over the surface of the plane.
They use computer graphics, and linear algebra provides
the engine for the graphics. The wire-frame model of the
plane’s surface is stored as data in many matrices. Once the
image has been rendered on a computer screen, engineers
can change its scale, zoom in or out of small regions, and
rotate the image to see parts that may be hidden from view.
Each of these operations is accomplished by appropriate

matrix multiplications. Section 2.7 explains the basic
ideas.
WEB
Our ability to analyze and solve equations will be greatly enhanced when we can perform
algebraic operations with matrices. Furthermore, the deﬁnitions and theorems in this
chapter provide some basic tools for handling the many applications of linear algebra
that involve two or more matrices. For square matrices, the Invertible Matrix Theorem
in Section 2.3 ties together most of the concepts treated earlier in the text. Sections 2.4
and 2.5 examine partitioned matrices and matrix factorizations, which appear in most
modern uses of linear algebra. Sections 2.6 and 2.7 describe two interesting applications
of matrix algebra, to economics and to computer graphics.
2.1 MATRIX OPERATIONS
IfAis anmnmatrix—that is, a matrix with mrows and ncolumns—then the scalar
entry in the ith row and jth column of Ais denoted by aijand is called the .i; j / -entry
ofA. See Figure 1. For instance, the .3; 2/ -entry is the number a32in the third row,
second column. Each column of Ais a list of mreal numbers, which identiﬁes a vector
inRm. Often, these columns are denoted by a1; : : : ; an, and the matrix Ais written as
ADa1a2 an
Observe that the number aijis the ith entry (from the top) of the jth column vector aj.
Thediagonal entries in an mnmatrix ADaijarea11; a22; a33; : : : ; and they
form the main diagonal ofA. Adiagonal matrix is a square nnmatrix whose
nondiagonal entries are zero. An example is the nnidentity matrix, In. Anmn
matrix whose entries are all zero is a zero matrix and is written as 0. The size of a zero
matrix is usually clear from the context.

Sums and Scalar Multiples
The arithmetic for vectors described earlier has a natural extension to matrices. We say
that two matrices are equal if they have the same size (i.e., the same number of rows
and the same number of columns) and if their corresponding columns are equal, which
amounts to saying that their corresponding entries are equal. If AandBaremn
matrices, then the sum ACBis the mnmatrix whose columns are the sums of
the corresponding columns in AandB. Since vector addition of the columns is done
entrywise, each entry in ACBis the sum of the corresponding entries in AandB. The
sumACBis deﬁned only when AandBare the same size.

butACCis not deﬁned because AandChave different sizes.
Ifris a scalar and Ais a matrix, then the scalar multiple rAis the matrix whose
columns are rtimes the corresponding columns in A. As with vectors,  Astands for
. 1/A, and A Bis the same as AC. 1/B.

96 CHAPTER 2 Matrix Algebra
Each equality in Theorem 1 is veriﬁed by showing that the matrix on the left side has
the same size as the matrix on the right and that corresponding columns are equal. Size
is no problem because A,B, and Care equal in size. The equality of columns follows
immediately from analogous properties of vectors. For instance, if the jth columns of
A,B, andCareaj,bj, and cj, respectively, then the jth columns of .ACB/CCand
AC.BCC /are
.ajCbj/Ccjand ajC.bjCcj/
respectively. Since these two vector sums are equal for each j, property (b) is veriﬁed.
Because of the associative property of addition, we can simply write ACBCC
for the sum, which can be computed either as .ACB/CCor as AC.BCC /. The
same applies to sums of four or more matrices.
Matrix Multiplication
When a matrix Bmultiplies a vector x, it transforms xinto the vector Bx. If this vector
is then multiplied in turn by a matrix A, the resulting vector is A.B x/. See Figure 2.

Each column of ABis a linear combination of the columns of Ausing weights
from the corresponding column of B.
Obviously, the number of columns of Amust match the number of rows in Bin
order for a linear combination such as Ab1to be deﬁned. Also, the deﬁnition of AB
shows that ABhas the same number of rows as A and the same number of columns
as B.

The deﬁnition of ABis important for theoretical work and applications, but the
following rule provides a more efﬁcient method for calculating the individual entries in
ABwhen working small problems by hand.
ROW--COLUMN RULE FOR COMPUTING AB
If the product ABis deﬁned, then the entry in row iand column jofABis the
sum of the products of corresponding entries from row iofAand column jof
B. If.AB/ ijdenotes the .i; j / -entry in AB, and if Ais anmnmatrix, then
.AB/ ijDai1b1jCai2b2jC  C ainbnj
To verify this rule, let BDb1 bp. Column jofABisAbj, and we can
compute Abjby the row–vector rule for computing Axfrom Section 1.4. The ith entry
inAbjis the sum of the products of corresponding entries from row iofAand the
vector bj, which is precisely the computation described in the rule for computing the
.i; j / -entry of AB.
EXAMPLE 5 Use the row–column rule to compute two of the entries in ABfor the
matrices in Example 3. An inspection of the numbers involved will make it clear how
the two methods for calculating ABproduce the same matrix.
SOLUTION To ﬁnd the entry in row 1 and column 3 of AB, consider row 1 of Aand
column 3 of B. Multiply corresponding entries and add the results, as shown below:

matter how we group the matrices when computing the product, so long as the left-to-
right order of the matrices is preserved.
The left-to-right order in products is critical because ABandBAare usually not
the same. This is not surprising, because the columns of ABare linear combinations of
the columns of A, whereas the columns of BAare constructed from the columns of B.
The position of the factors in the product ABis emphasized by saying that Aisright-
multiplied byBor that Bisleft-multiplied byA. IfABDBA, we say that AandB
commute with one another.

AD0orBD0. (See Exercise 12.)

1.The fastest way to obtain ABon a computer depends on the way in which
the computer stores matrices in its memory. The standard high-performance
algorithms, such as in LAPACK, calculate ABby columns, as in our deﬁnition
of the product. (A version of LAPACK written in C++ calculates ABby rows.)
2.The deﬁnition of ABlends itself well to parallel processing on a computer. The
columns of Bare assigned individually or in groups to different processors,
which independently and hence simultaneously compute the corresponding
columns of AB.

useful formulas in ways similar to doing ordinary algebra with real numbers. This section

investigates the matrix analogue of the reciprocal, or multiplicative inverse, of a nonzero
number.
Recall that the multiplicative inverse of a number such as 5 is 1/5 or 5 1. This
inverse satisﬁes the equations
5 15D1and 55 1D1
The matrix generalization requires both equations and avoids the slanted-line notation
(for division) because matrix multiplication is not commutative. Furthermore, a full
generalization is possible only if the matrices involved are square.1

Invertible matrices are indispensable in linear algebra—mainly for algebraic calcu-

an inverse matrix provides insight into a mathematical model of a real-life situation, as
in Example 3, below.

thenAxDA.A 1b/D.AA 1/bDIbDb. SoA 1bis a solution. To prove that the

three points to produce a unit deﬂection at point 1 and zero deﬂections at the other points.
Similarly, columns 2 and 3 of D 1list the forces required to produce unit deﬂections at
points 2 and 3, respectively. In each column, one or two of the forces must be negative
(point upward) to produce a unit deﬂection at the desired point and zero deﬂections at
the other two points. If the ﬂexibility is measured, for example, in inches of deﬂection
per pound of load, then the stiffness matrix entries are given in pounds of load per inch
of deﬂection.
The formula in Theorem 5 is seldom used to solve an equation AxDbnumerically
because row reduction of Abis nearly always faster. (Row reduction is usually
more accurate, too, when computations involve rounding off numbers.) One possible
exception is the 22case. In this case, mental computations to solve AxDbare
sometimes easier using the formula for A 1, as in the next example.

The next theorem provides three useful facts about invertible matrices.
T H E O R E M 6 a.IfAis an invertible matrix, then A 1is invertible and
.A 1/ 1DA
b.IfAandBarenninvertible matrices, then so is AB, and the inverse of AB
is the product of the inverses of AandBin the reverse order. That is,
.AB/ 1DB 1A 1
c.IfAis an invertible matrix, then so is AT, and the inverse of ATis the transpose
ofA 1. That is,
.AT/ 1D.A 1/T
PROOF To verify statement (a), ﬁnd a matrix Csuch that
A 1CDIand CA 1DI
In fact, these equations are satisﬁed with Ain place of C. Hence A 1is invertible, and
Ais its inverse. Next, to prove statement (b), compute:
.AB/.B 1A 1/DA.BB 1/A 1DAIA 1DAA 1DI
A similar calculation shows that .B 1A 1/.AB/ DI. For statement (c), use Theorem
3(d), read from right to left, .A 1/TATD.AA 1/TDITDI. Similarly, AT.A 1/TD
ITDI. Hence ATis invertible, and its inverse is .A 1/T.
Remark: Part (b) illustrates the important role that deﬁnitions play in proofs. The the-
orem claims that B 1A 1is the inverse of AB. The proof establishes this by showing
thatB 1A 1satisﬁes the deﬁnition of what it means to be the inverse of AB. Now, the
inverse of ABis a matrix that when multiplied on the left (or right) by AB, the product
is the identity matrix I. So the proof consists of showing that B 1A 1has this property.

108 CHAPTER 2 Matrix Algebra
The following generalization of Theorem 6(b) is needed later.
The product of nninvertible matrices is invertible, and the inverse is the
product of their inverses in the reverse order.
There is an important connection between invertible matrices and row operations
that leads to a method for computing inverses. As we shall see, an invertible matrix Ais
row equivalent to an identity matrix, and we can ﬁnd A 1bywatching the row reduction
ofAtoI.

Anelementary matrix is one that is obtained by performing a single elementary row
operation on an identity matrix. The next example illustrates the three kinds of elemen-
tary matrices.

Addition of  4times row 1 of Ato row 3 produces E1A. (This is a row replacement

same effect on any 3nmatrix. It adds  4times row 1 to row 3. In particular, since
E1IDE1, we see that E1itself is produced by this same row operation on the identity.
Thus Example 5 illustrates the following general fact about elementary matrices. See
Exercises 27 and 28.
If an elementary row operation is performed on an mnmatrix A, the resulting
matrix can be written as EA, where the mmmatrix Eis created by performing
the same row operation on Im.

2.2 The Inverse of a Matrix 109
Since row operations are reversible, as shown in Section 1.1, elementary matrices
are invertible, for if Eis produced by a row operation on I, then there is another row op-
eration of the same type that changes Eback into I. Hence there is an elementary matrix
Fsuch that FEDI. Since EandFcorrespond to reverse operations, EFDI, too.
Each elementary matrix Eis invertible. The inverse of Eis the elementary matrix
of the same type that transforms Eback into I.

The following theorem provides the best way to “visualize” an invertible matrix,
and the theorem leads immediately to a method for ﬁnding the inverse of a matrix.
T H E O R E M 7 Annnmatrix Ais invertible if and only if Ais row equivalent to In, and in
this case, any sequence of elementary row operations that reduces AtoInalso
transforms InintoA 1.
Remark: The comment on the proof of Theorem 11 in Chapter 1 noted that “ Pif and
only if Q” is equivalent to two statements: (1) “If PthenQ” and (2) “If QthenP.”
The second statement is called the converse of the ﬁrst and explains the use of the word
conversely in the second paragraph of this proof.
PROOF Suppose that Ais invertible. Then, since the equation AxDbhas a solution
for each b(Theorem 5), Ahas a pivot position in every row (Theorem 4 in Section 1.4).
Because Ais square, the npivot positions must be on the diagonal, which implies that
the reduced echelon form of AisIn. That is, AIn.
Now suppose, conversely, that AIn. Then, since each step of the row reduction
ofAcorresponds to left-multiplication by an elementary matrix, there exist elementary
matrices E1; : : : ; E psuch that
AE1AE2.E1A/   Ep.Ep 1E1A/DIn
That is,

.EpE1/ 1.EpE1/AD.EpE1/ 1In

An Algorithm for Finding A–1
If we place AandIside by side to form an augmented matrix A I , then row
operations on this matrix produce identical operations on Aand on I. By Theorem 7,
either there are row operations that transform AtoInandIntoA 1or else Ais not
invertible.
ALGORITHM FOR FINDING A–1
Row reduce the augmented matrix A I . IfAis row equivalent to I, then
A I is row equivalent to I A 1. Otherwise, Adoes not have an inverse.

T H E O R E M 8 The Invertible Matrix Theorem
LetAbe a square nnmatrix. Then the following statements are equivalent.
That is, for a given A, the statements are either all true or all false.
a.Ais an invertible matrix.
b.Ais row equivalent to the nnidentity matrix.
c.Ahasnpivot positions.
d.The equation AxD0has only the trivial solution.
e.The columns of Aform a linearly independent set.
f.The linear transformation x7!Axis one-to-one.
g.The equation AxDbhas at least one solution for each binRn.
h.The columns of AspanRn.
i.The linear transformation x7!AxmapsRnontoRn.
j.There is an nnmatrix Csuch that CADI.
k.There is an nnmatrix Dsuch that ADDI.
l.ATis an invertible matrix.
First, we need some notation. If the truth of statement (a) always implies that state-
(c) (d)(j )(a)
(b)
FIGURE 1ment (j) is true, we say that (a) implies (j) and write (a) )(j). The proof will establish
the “circle” of implications shown in Figure 1. If any one of these ﬁve statements is
true, then so are the others. Finally, the proof will link the remaining statements of the
theorem to the statements in this circle.
PROOF If statement (a) is true, then A 1works for Cin (j), so (a) )(j). Next, (j) )(d)
by Exercise 23 in Section 2.1. (Turn back and read the exercise.) Also, (d) )(c) by
Exercise 23 in Section 2.2. If Ais square and has npivot positions, then the pivots
must lie on the main diagonal, in which case the reduced echelon form of AisIn:Thus
(c))(b). Also, (b) )(a) by Theorem 7 in Section 2.2. This completes the circle in
Figure 1.
Next, (a) )(k) because A 1works for D. Also, (k) )(g) by Exercise 24 in Sec-
tion 2.1, and (g) )(a) by Exercise 24 in Section 2.2. So (k) and (g) are linked to
the circle. Further, (g), (h), and (i) are equivalent for any matrix, by Theorem 4 in
Section 1.4 and Theorem 12(a) in Section 1.9. Thus, (h) and (i) are linked through (g) to
the circle.
Since (d) is linked to the circle, so are (e) and (f), because (d), (e), and (f) are all
equivalent for anymatrix A. (See Section 1.7 and Theorem 12(b) in Section 1.9.) Finally,
(a))(l) by Theorem 6(c) in Section 2.2, and (l) )(a) by the same theorem with Aand
ATinterchanged. This completes the proof.
(g)(k)
(h)(a)
(l) (a)(i) (g)
(e) (f ) (d)
Because of Theorem 5 in Section 2.2, statement (g) in Theorem 8 could also be
written as “The equation AxDbhas a unique solution for each binRn.” This statement
certainly implies (b) and hence implies that Ais invertible.
The next fact follows from Theorem 8 and Exercise 8 in Section 2.2.
LetAandBbe square matrices. If ABDI, then AandBare both invertible,

2.3 Characterizations of Invertible Matrices 115
The Invertible Matrix Theorem divides the set of all nnmatrices into two disjoint
classes: the invertible (nonsingular) matrices, and the noninvertible (singular) matrices.
Each statement in the theorem describes a property of every nninvertible matrix.
Thenegation of a statement in the theorem describes a property of every nnsingular
matrix. For instance, an nnsingular matrix is notrow equivalent to In, does nothave
npivot positions, and has linearly dependent columns. Negations of other statements
are considered in the exercises.
EXAMPLE 1 Use the Invertible Matrix Theorem to decide if Ais invertible:

SoAhas three pivot positions and hence is invertible, by the Invertible Matrix Theorem,
statement (c).
The power of the Invertible Matrix Theorem lies in the connections it provides
SG Expanded Table
for the IMT 2–10 among so many important concepts, such as linear independence of columns of a matrix
Aand the existence of solutions to equations of the form AxDb. It should be empha-
sized, however, that the Invertible Matrix Theorem applies only to square matrices . For
example, if the columns of a 43matrix are linearly independent, we cannot use the
Invertible Matrix Theorem to conclude anything about the existence or nonexistence of
solutions to equations of the form AxDb.
Invertible Linear Transformations
Recall from Section 2.1 that matrix multiplication corresponds to composition of linear
transformations. When a matrix Ais invertible, the equation A 1AxDxcan be viewed
as a statement about linear transformations. See Figure 2.

In practical work, you might occasionally encounter a “nearly singular” or ill-
conditioned matrix—an invertible matrix that can become singular if some of
its entries are changed ever so slightly. In this case, row reduction may produce
fewer than npivot positions, as a result of roundoff error. Also, roundoff error
can sometimes make a singular matrix appear to be invertible.
Some matrix programs will compute a condition number for a square
matrix. The larger the condition number, the closer the matrix is to being singular.
The condition number of the identity matrix is 1. A singular matrix has an
inﬁnite condition number. In extreme cases, a matrix program may not be able to
distinguish between a singular matrix and an ill-conditioned matrix.
Exercises 41– 45 show that matrix computations can produce substantial
error when a condition number is large.

SOLUTIONS TO PRACTICE PROBLEMS
1.The columns of Aare obviously linearly dependent because columns 2 and 3 are mul-
tiples of column 1. Hence Acannot be invertible, by the Invertible Matrix
Theorem.

2.If statement (g) is nottrue, then the equation AxDbis inconsistent for at least one
binRn.
3.Apply the Invertible Matrix Theorem to the matrix ABin place of A. Then statement
(d) becomes: ABxD0has only the trivial solution. This is not true. So ABis not
invertible.
2.4 PARTITIONED MATRICES
A key feature of our work with matrices has been the ability to regard a matrix Aas a list
of column vectors rather than just a rectangular array of numbers. This point of view has
been so useful that we wish to consider other partitions ofA, indicated by horizontal
and vertical dividing rules, as in Example 1 below. Partitioned matrices appear in most
modern applications of linear algebra because the notation highlights essential struc-
tures in matrix analysis, as in the chapter introductory example on aircraft design. This
section provides an opportunity to review matrix algebra and use the Invertible Matrix
Theorem.
EXAMPLE 1 The matrix

EXAMPLE 2 When a matrix Aappears in a mathematical model of a physical
system such as an electrical network, a transportation system, or a large corporation,
it may be natural to regard Aas a partitioned matrix. For instance, if a microcomputer
circuit board consists mainly of three VLSI (very large-scale integrated) microchips,
then the matrix for the circuit board might have the general form
AD2
64A11 A12 A13
A21 A22 A23
A31 A32 A333
75
The submatrices on the “diagonal” of A—namely, A11,A22, andA33—concern the three
VLSI chips, while the other submatrices depend on the interconnections among those
microchips.
Addition and Scalar Multiplication
If matrices AandBare the same size and are partitioned in exactly the same way,
then it is natural to make the same partition of the ordinary matrix sum ACB. In this
SECOND REVISED PAGES

120 CHAPTER 2 Matrix Algebra
case, each block of ACBis the (matrix) sum of the corresponding blocks of AandB.
Multiplication of a partitioned matrix by a scalar is also computed block by block.
Multiplication of Partitioned Matrices
Partitioned matrices can be multiplied by the usual row–column rule as if the block
entries were scalars, provided that for a product AB, the column partition of Amatches
the row partition of B.

The 5 columns of Aare partitioned into a set of 3 columns and then a set of 2
columns. The 5 rows of Bare partitioned in the same way—into a set of 3 rows and
then a set of 2 rows. We say that the partitions of AandBareconformable forblock
multiplication . It can be shown that the ordinary product ABcan be written as

It is important for each smaller product in the expression for ABto be written with
the submatrix from Aon the left, since matrix multiplication is not commutative. For
instance,

The row–column rule for multiplication of block matrices provides the most general
way to regard the product of two matrices. Each of the following views of a product
has already been described using simple partitions of matrices: (1) the deﬁnition of Ax
using the columns of A, (2) the column deﬁnition of AB, (3) the row–column rule for
computing AB, and (4) the rows of ABas products of the rows of Aand the matrix B.
A ﬁfth view of AB, again using partitions, follows in Theorem 10 below.
The calculations in the next example prepare the way for Theorem 10. Here col k.A/
is the kth column of A, and row k.B/is the kth row of B.

Ablock diagonal matrix is a partitioned matrix with zero blocks off the main
diagonal (of blocks). Such a matrix is invertible if and only if each block on the diagonal
is invertible. See Exercises 13 and 14.
N U M E R I C A L N O T E S
1.When matrices are too large to ﬁt in a computer’s high-speed memory,
partitioning permits the computer to work with only two or three submatrices
at a time. For instance, one linear programming research team simpliﬁed
a problem by partitioning the matrix into 837 rows and 51 columns. The
problem’s solution took about 4 minutes on a Cray supercomputer.1
2.Some high-speed computers, particularly those with vector pipeline architec-
ture, perform matrix calculations more efﬁciently when the algorithms use
partitioned matrices.2
3.Professional software for high-performance numerical linear algebra, such as
LAPACK, makes intensive use of partitioned matrix calculations.
1The solution time doesn’t sound too impressive until you learn that each of the 51 block columns contained
about 250,000 individual columns. The original problem had 837 equations and more than 12,750,000
variables! Nearly 100 million of the more than 10 billion entries in the matrix were nonzero. See Robert E.

Simplex Methods,” Operations Research , 40, no. 5 (1992): 885–897.

2.5 MATRIX FACTORIZATIONS
Afactorization of a matrix Ais an equation that expresses Aas a product of two or more
matrices. Whereas matrix multiplication involves a synthesis of data (combining the
effects of two or more linear transformations into a single matrix), matrix factorization
is an analysis of data. In the language of computer science, the expression of Aas a
product amounts to a preprocessing of the data in A, organizing that data into two or
more parts whose structures are more useful in some way, perhaps more accessible for
computation.

126 CHAPTER 2 Matrix Algebra
Matrix factorizations and, later, factorizations of linear transformations will appear
at a number of key points throughout the text. This section focuses on a factorization
that lies at the heart of several important computer programs widely used in applica-
tions, such as the airﬂow problem described in the chapter introduction. Several other
factorizations, to be studied later, are introduced in the exercises.
The LU Factorization
The LU factorization, described below, is motivated by the fairly common industrial
and business problem of solving a sequence of equations, all with the same coefﬁcient
matrix:
AxDb1; A xDb2; : : : ; A xDbp (1)
See Exercise 32, for example. Also see Section 5.8, where the inverse power method
is used to estimate eigenvalues of a matrix by solving equations like those in sequence
(1), one at a time.
When Ais invertible, one could compute A 1and then compute A 1b1,A 1b2,
and so on. However, it is more efﬁcient to solve the ﬁrst equation in sequence (1) by
row reduction and obtain an LU factorization of Aat the same time. Thereafter, the
remaining equations in sequence (1) are solved with the LU factorization.
At ﬁrst, assume that Ais anmnmatrix that can be row reduced to echelon form,
without row interchanges . (Later, we will treat the general case.) Then Acan be written
in the form ADLU, where Lis an mmlower triangular matrix with 1’s on the
diagonal and Uis an mnechelon form of A. For instance, see Figure 1. Such a
factorization is called an LU factorization ofA. The matrix Lis invertible and is called
aunitlower triangular matrix.

Before studying how to construct LandU, we should look at why they are so
useful. When ADLU, the equation AxDbcan be written as L.U x/Db. Writing y
forUx, we can ﬁnd xby solving the pair of equations
LyDb
UxDy(2)
First solve LyDbfory;and then solve UxDyforx. See Figure 2. Each equation is
easy to solve because LandUare triangular.

Then, for UxDy, the “backward” phase of row reduction requires 4 divisions, 6 mul-
tiplications, and 6 additions. (For instance, creating the zeros in column 4 of Uy
requires 1 division in row 4 and 3 multiplication–addition pairs to add multiples of row 4
to the rows above.)

To ﬁnd xrequires 28 arithmetic operations, or “ﬂops” (ﬂoating point operations),
excluding the cost of ﬁnding LandU. In contrast, row reduction of AbtoIx
takes 62 operations.
The computational efﬁciency of the LU factorization depends on knowing LandU.
The next algorithm shows that the row reduction of Ato an echelon form Uamounts to
an LU factorization because it produces Lwith essentially no extra work. After the ﬁrst
row reduction, LandUare available for solving additional equations whose coefﬁcient
matrix is A.
An LU Factorization Algorithm
Suppose Acan be reduced to an echelon form Uusing only row replacements that add a
multiple of one row to another row below it . In this case, there exist unit lower triangular
elementary matrices E1; : : : ; E psuch that

128 CHAPTER 2 Matrix Algebra
It can be shown that products and inverses of unit lower triangular matrices are also unit
lower triangular. (For instance, see Exercise 19.) Thus Lis unit lower triangular.
Note that the row operations in equation (3), which reduce AtoU, also reduce
theLin equation (4) to I, because EpE1LD.EpE1/.EpE1/ 1DI. This
observation is the key to constructing L.
ALGORITHM FOR AN LU FACTORIZATION
1.Reduce Ato an echelon form Uby a sequence of row replacement operations,
if possible.
2.Place entries in Lsuch that the same sequence of row operations reduces L
toI.
Step 1 is not always possible, but when it is, the argument above shows that an LU
factorization exists. Example 2 will show how to implement step 2. By construction, L
will satisfy
.EpE1/LDI
using the same E1; : : : ; E pas in equation (3). Thus Lwill be invertible, by the Invertible
Matrix Theorem, with .EpE1/DL 1. From (3), L 1ADU, and ADLU. So
step 2 will produce an acceptable L.

Compare the ﬁrst columns of AandL.The row operations that create zeros in the
ﬁrst column of Awill also create zeros in the ﬁrst column of L. To make this same
correspondence of row operations on Ahold for the rest of L, watch a row reduction
ofAto an echelon form U. That is, highlight the entries in each matrix that are used to
determine the sequence of row operations that transform AintoU. [See the highlighted

An easy calculation veriﬁes that this LandUsatisfy LUDA.
In practical work, row interchanges are nearly always needed, because partial piv-
oting is used for high accuracy. (Recall that this procedure selects, among the possible
choices for a pivot, an entry in the column having the largest absolute value.) To handle
row interchanges, the LU factorization above can be modiﬁed easily to produce an L
that is permuted lower triangular , in the sense that a rearrangement (called a permu-
tation) of the rows of Lcan make L .unit/lower triangular. The resulting permuted
LU factorization solves AxDbin the same way as before, except that the reduction of
LbtoIyfollows the order of the pivots in Lfrom left to right, starting with
the pivot in the ﬁrst column. A reference to an “LU factorization” usually includes the
possibility that Lmight be permuted lower triangular. For details, see the Study Guide .

1.Computing an LU factorization of Atakes about 2n3=3ﬂops (about the same
as row reducing Ab/, whereas ﬁnding A 1requires about 2n3ﬂops.
2.Solving LyDbandUxDyrequires about 2n2ﬂops, because any nn

3.Multiplication of bbyA 1also requires about 2n2ﬂops, but the result may
not be as accurate as that obtained from LandU(because of roundoff error
when computing both A 1andA 1b/.
4.IfAis sparse (with mostly zero entries), then LandUmay be sparse, too,
whereas A 1is likely to be dense. In this case, a solution of AxDbwith an
LU factorization is much faster than using A 1. See Exercise 31.

A network transfer matrix summarizes the input–output behavior (the design spec-
iﬁcations) of the network without reference to the interior circuits. To physically build
a network with speciﬁed properties, an engineer ﬁrst determines if such a network
can be constructed (or realized ). Then the engineer tries to factor the transfer matrix
into matrices corresponding to smaller circuits that perhaps are already manufactured
and ready for assembly. In the common case of alternating current, the entries in the
transfer matrix are usually rational complex-valued functions. (See Exercises 19 and 20
in Section 2.4 and Example 2 in Section 3.3.) A standard problem is to ﬁnd a minimal
realization that uses the smallest number of electrical components.

2.6 THE LEONTIEF INPUT OUTPUT MODEL
Linear algebra played an essential role in the Nobel prize–winning work of Wassily
WEB
Leontief, as mentioned at the beginning of Chapter 1. The economic model described
in this section is the basis for more elaborate models used in many parts of the world.
Suppose a nation’s economy is divided into nsectors that produce goods or services,
and let xbe a production vector inRnthat lists the output of each sector for one
year. Also, suppose another part of the economy (called the open sector ) does not
produce goods or services but only consumes them, and let dbe aﬁnal demand vector
(orbill of ﬁnal demands) that lists the values of the goods and services demanded
from the various sectors by the nonproductive part of the economy. The vector dcan
represent consumer demand, government consumption, surplus production, exports, or
other external demands.
As the various sectors produce goods to meet consumer demand, the producers
themselves create additional intermediate demand for goods they need as inputs for
their own production. The interrelations between the sectors are very complex, and the
connection between the ﬁnal demand and the production is unclear. Leontief asked if
there is a production level xsuch that the amounts produced (or “supplied”) will exactly
balance the total demand for that production, so that

<
:amount
produced
x9
=
;Dintermediate
demand
C8
<
:ﬁnal

d9

;(1)
The basic assumption of Leontief’s input–output model is that for each sector, there
is aunit consumption vector inRnthat lists the inputs needed per unit of output of
the sector. All input and output units are measured in millions of dollars, rather than in
quantities such as tons or bushels. (Prices of goods and services are held constant.)
As a simple example, suppose the economy consists of three sectors—manufac-
turing, agriculture, and services—with unit consumption vectors c1,c2, and c3, as shown
in the table that follows.

To produce 100 units, manufacturing will order (i.e., “demand”) and consume 50 units
from other parts of the manufacturing sector, 20 units from agriculture, and 10 units
from services.
If manufacturing decides to produce x1units of output, then x1c1represents the
intermediate demands of manufacturing, because the amounts in x1c1will be consumed
in the process of creating the x1units of output. Likewise, if x2andx3denote the planned
outputs of the agriculture and services sectors, x2c2andx3c3list their corresponding
intermediate demands. The total intermediate demand from all three sectors is given by

The last column is rounded to the nearest whole unit. Manufacturing must produce
approximately 226 units, agriculture 119 units, and services only 78 units.
If the matrix I Cis invertible, then we can apply Theorem 5 in Section 2.2, with
Areplaced by .I C /, and from the equation .I C /xDdobtain xD.I C / 1d.
The theorem below shows that in most practical cases, I Cisinvertible and the
production vector xis economically feasible, in the sense that the entries in xare non-
negative.
In the theorem, the term column sum denotes the sum of the entries in a column
of a matrix. Under ordinary circumstances, the column sums of a consumption matrix
are less than 1 because a sector should require less than one unit’s worth of inputs to
produce one unit of output.
T H E O R E M 1 1 LetCbe the consumption matrix for an economy, and let dbe the ﬁnal demand.
IfCanddhave nonnegative entries and if each column sum of Cis less than 1,
then.I C / 1exists and the production vector
xD.I C / 1d
has nonnegative entries and is the unique solution of
xDCxCd
The following discussion will suggest why the theorem is true and will lead to a
new way to compute .I C / 1.
A Formula for (I – C) –1
Imagine that the demand represented by dis presented to the various industries at the
beginning of the year, and the industries respond by setting their production levels at
xDd, which will exactly meet the ﬁnal demand. As the industries prepare to produce d,
they send out orders for their raw materials and other inputs. This creates an intermediate
demand of Cdfor inputs.
To meet the additional demand of Cd, the industries will need as additional inputs
the amounts in C.Cd/DC2d. Of course, this creates a second round of intermediate
demand, and when the industries decide to produce even more to meet this new demand,
they create a third round of demand, namely, C.C2d/DC3d. And so it goes.
Theoretically, this process could continue indeﬁnitely, although in real life it would
not take place in such a rigid sequence of events. We can diagram this hypothetical
situation as follows:

To make sense of equation (6), consider the following algebraic identity:
.I C /.ICCCC2C  C Cm/DI CmC1(7)
It can be shown that if the column sums in Care all strictly less than 1, then I Cis in-
vertible, Cmapproaches the zero matrix as mgets arbitrarily large, and I CmC1!I.
(This fact is analogous to the fact that if a positive number tis less than 1, then tm!0
asmincreases.) Using equation (7), write
.I C / 1ICCCC2CC3C  C Cm
when the column sums of Care less than 1.(8)
The approximation in (8) means that the right side can be made as close to .I C / 1
as desired by taking msufﬁciently large.
In actual input–output models, powers of the consumption matrix approach the zero
matrix rather quickly. So (8) really provides a practical way to compute .I C / 1.
Likewise, for any d, the vectors Cmdapproach the zero vector quickly, and (6) is a
practical way to solve .I C /xDd. If the entries in Canddare nonnegative, then (6)
shows that the entries in xare nonnegative, too.
The Economic Importance of Entries in (I – C) –1
The entries in .I C / 1are signiﬁcant because they can be used to predict how the
production xwill have to change when the ﬁnal demand dchanges. In fact, the entries
in column jof.I C / 1are the increased amounts the various sectors will have to
produce in order to satisfy an increase of 1 unit in the ﬁnal demand for output from
sector j. See Exercise 8.
N U M E R I C A L N O T E
In any applied problem (not just in economics), an equation AxDbcan always be
written as .I C /xDb, with CDI A. If the system is large and sparse (with
mostly zero entries), it can happen that the column sums of the absolute values in
Care less than 1. In this case, Cm!0. IfCmapproaches zero quickly enough,
(6) and (8) will provide practical formulas for solving AxDband ﬁnding A 1.

PRACTICE PROBLEM
Suppose an economy has two sectors: goods and services. One unit of output from goods
requires inputs of .2 unit from goods and .5 unit from services. One unit of output from
services requires inputs of .4 unit from goods and .3 unit from services. There is a ﬁnal
demand of 20 units of goods and 30 units of services. Set up the Leontief input–output
model for this situation.
2.6 EXERCISES
Agriculture Manufacturing Services
Open Sector
Exercises 1–4 refer to an economy that is divided into three
sectors—manufacturing, agriculture, and services. For each unit
of output, manufacturing requires .10 unit from other companies
in that sector, .30 unit from agriculture, and .30 unit from services.
For each unit of output, agriculture uses .20 unit of its own output,
.60 unit from manufacturing, and .10 unit from services. For each
unit of output, the services sector consumes .10 unit from services,
.60 unit from manufacturing, but no agricultural products.
1.Construct the consumption matrix for this economy, and de-
termine what intermediate demands are created if agriculture
plans to produce 100 units.
2.Determine the production levels needed to satisfy a ﬁnal
demand of 18 units for agriculture, with no ﬁnal demand for
the other sectors. (Do not compute an inverse matrix.)

and 0 units for services.

10. The consumption matrix Cfor the U.S. economy in 1972
has the property that every entry in the matrix .I C / 1is
nonzero (and positive).1What does that say about the effect
of raising the demand for the output of just one sector of the
economy?
11.The Leontief production equation, xDCxCd;is usually
accompanied by a dual price equation ,
pDCTpCv
where pis aprice vector whose entries list the price per unit
for each sector’s output, and vis avalue added vector whose
entries list the value added per unit of output. (Value added
includes wages, proﬁt, depreciation, etc.) An important fact
in economics is that the gross domestic product (GDP) can
be expressed in two ways:

2.7 APPLICATIONS TO COMPUTER GRAPHICS
Computer graphics are images displayed or animated on a computer screen. Applica-
tions of computer graphics are widespread and growing rapidly. For instance, computer-
aided design (CAD) is an integral part of many engineering processes, such as the
aircraft design process described in the chapter introduction. The entertainment industry
has made the most spectacular use of computer graphics—from the special effects in
Amazing Spider-Man 2 to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
Most interactive computer software for business and industry makes use of com-
puter graphics in the screen displays and for other functions, such as graphical display
of data, desktop publishing, and slide production for commercial and educational pre-
sentations. Consequently, anyone studying a computer language invariably spends time
learning how to use at least two-dimensional (2D) graphics.
This section examines some of the basic mathematics used to manipulate and dis-
play graphical images such as a wire-frame model of an airplane. Such an image (or
picture) consists of a number of points, connecting lines or curves, and information
about how to ﬁll in closed regions bounded by the lines and curves. Often, curved lines
are approximated by short straight-line segments, and a ﬁgure is deﬁned mathematically
by a list of points.
Among the simplest 2D graphics symbols are letters used for labels on the screen.
Some letters are stored as wire-frame objects; others that have curved portions are stored
with additional mathematical formulas for the curves.
EXAMPLE 1 The capital letter N in Figure 1 is determined by eight points, or
vertices . The coordinates of the points can be stored in a data matrix, D.

In addition to D, it is necessary to specify which vertices are connected by lines, but we
omit this detail.
The main reason graphical objects are described by collections of straight-line seg-
ments is that the standard transformations in computer graphics map line segments onto
other line segments. (For instance, see Exercise 27 in Section 1.8.) Once the vertices

that describe an object have been transformed, their images can be connected with the
appropriate straight lines to produce the complete image of the original object.

The result of this composite transformation is shown in Figure 3.
The mathematics of computer graphics is intimately connected with matrix multi-
plication. Unfortunately, translating an object on a screen does not correspond directly
to matrix multiplication because translation is not a linear transformation. The standard
way to avoid this difﬁculty is to introduce what are called homogeneous coordinates .
Homogeneous Coordinates
Each point .x; y/ inR2can be identiﬁed with the point .x; y; 1/ on the plane in R3
that lies one unit above the xy-plane. We say that .x; y/ hashomogeneous coordinates
.x; y; 1/ . For instance, the point .0; 0/ has homogeneous coordinates .0; 0; 1/ . Homo-
geneous coordinates for points are not added or multiplied by scalars, but they can be
transformed via multiplication by 33matrices.
EXAMPLE 4 A translation of the form .x; y/7!.xCh; yCk/is written in ho-
mogeneous coordinates as .x; y; 1/ 7!.xCh; yCk; 1/ . This transformation can be
computed via matrix multiplication:

Composite Transformations
The movement of a ﬁgure on a computer screen often requires two or more basic trans-
formations. The composition of such transformations corresponds to matrix multiplica-
tion when homogeneous coordinates are used.

3D Computer Graphics
Some of the newest and most exciting work in computer graphics is connected with
molecular modeling. With 3D (three-dimensional) graphics, a biologist can examine a
simulated protein molecule and search for active sites that might accept a drug molecule.
The biologist can rotate and translate an experimental drug and attempt to attach it to the
protein. This ability to visualize potential chemical reactions is vital to modern drug and
cancer research. In fact, advances in drug design depend to some extent upon progress
SECOND REVISED PAGES


--- Page 160 ---
2.7 Applications to Computer Graphics 143
in the ability of computer graphics to construct realistic simulations of molecules and
their interactions.1
Current research in molecular modeling is focused on virtual reality , an environ-
ment in which a researcher can see and feelthe drug molecule slide into the protein. In
Figure 4, such tactile feedback is provided by a force-displaying remote manipulator.
FIGURE 4 Molecular modeling in virtual reality.
Another design for virtual reality involves a helmet and glove that detect head, hand, and
ﬁnger movements. The helmet contains two tiny computer screens, one for each eye.
Making this virtual environment more realistic is a challenge to engineers, scientists,
and mathematicians. The mathematics we examine here barely opens the door to this
interesting ﬁeld of research.
Homogeneous 3D Coordinates
By analogy with the 2D case, we say that .x; y; ´; 1/ are homogeneous coordinates for
the point .x; y; ´/ inR3. In general, .X; Y; Z; H/ arehomogeneous coordinates for
.x; y; ´/ ifH¤0and
xDX
H; y DY
H;and ´DZ
H(1)
Each nonzero scalar multiple of .x; y; ´; 1/ gives a set of homogeneous coordinates
for.x; y; ´/ . For instance, both .10; 6; 14; 2/ and. 15; 9; 21; 3/are homogeneous
coordinates for .5; 3; 7/.
The next example illustrates the transformations used in molecular modeling to
move a drug into a protein molecule.
EXAMPLE 7 Give 44matrices for the following transformations:
a.Rotation about the y-axis through an angle of 30. (By convention, a positive angle

Perspective Projections
A three-dimensional object is represented on the two-dimensional computer screen by
projecting the object onto a viewing plane . (We ignore other important steps, such as
selecting the portion of the viewing plane to display on the screen.) For simplicity, let
thexy-plane represent the computer screen, and imagine that the eye of a viewer is
along the positive ´-axis, at a point .0; 0; d/ . Aperspective projection maps each point
.x; y; ´/ onto an image point .x; y; 0/so that the two points and the eye position,
called the center of projection , are on a line. See Figure 6(a).

can speed up calculations that determine how a graphic image
actually appears in terms of screen pixels. (The screen con-

ﬁrst transformation A1shears vertically and then compresses
each column of pixels; the second transformation A2shears
horizontally and then stretches each row of pixels. Let

Exercises 21 and 22 concern the way in which color is speciﬁed
for display in computer graphics. A color on a computer screen
is encoded by three numbers ( R,G,B) that list the amount of
energy an electron gun must transmit to red, green, and blue
phosphor dots on the computer screen. (A fourth number speciﬁes
the luminance or intensity of the color.)
21. [M] The actual color a viewer sees on a screen is inﬂuenced
by the speciﬁc type and amount of phosphors on the screen.
So each computer screen manufacturer must convert between
the (R,G,B) data and an international CIE standard for color,
which uses three primary colors, called X,Y, and Z. A typical
conversion for short-persistence phosphors is

2.8 SUBSPACES OF Rn
This section focuses on important sets of vectors in Rncalled subspaces . Often sub-
spaces arise in connection with some matrix A;and they provide useful information
about the equation AxDb. The concepts and terminology in this section will be used
repeatedly throughout the rest of the book.1
D E F I N I T I O N Asubspace ofRnis any set HinRnthat has three properties:
a.The zero vector is in H.
b.For each uandvinH, the sum uCvis inH.
c.For each uinHand each scalar c, the vector cuis inH.
In words, a subspace is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. As you will
see in the next few examples, most sets of vectors discussed in Chapter 1 are subspaces.
For instance, a plane through the origin is the standard way to visualize the subspace in
Example 1. See Figure 1.
EXAMPLE 1 Ifv1andv2are inRnandHDSpanfv1;v2g, then His a subspace
ofRn. To verify this statement, note that the zero vector is in H(because 0v1C0v2is
a linear combination of v1andv2/. Now take two arbitrary vectors in H, say,
0x3
v2 v1

Spanfv1;v2gas a plane through
the origin.uDs1v1Cs2v2and vDt1v1Ct2v2
Then
uCvD.s1Ct1/v1C.s2Ct2/v2
which shows that uCvis a linear combination of v1andv2and hence is in H. Also, for
any scalar c, the vector cuis inH, because cuDc.s1v1Cs2v2/D.cs1/v1C.cs2/v2.
Ifv1is not zero and if v2is a multiple of v1, then v1andv2simply span a line
through the origin. So a line through the origin is another example of a subspace.
1Sections 2.8 and 2.9 are included here to permit readers to postpone the study of most or all of the next two
chapters and to skip directly to Chapter 5, if so desired. Omit these two sections if you plan to work through
Chapter 4 before beginning Chapter 5.

EXAMPLE 3 Forv1; : : : ; vpinRn, the set of all linear combinations of v1; : : : ; vp
is a subspace of Rn. The veriﬁcation of this statement is similar to the argument given
in Example 1. We shall now refer to Span fv1; : : : ; vpgasthe subspace spanned (or
generated ) byv1; : : : ; vp.
Note that Rnis a subspace of itself because it has the three properties required for
a subspace. Another special subspace is the set consisting of only the zero vector in Rn.
This set, called the zero subspace , also satisﬁes the conditions for a subspace.
Column Space and Null Space of a Matrix
Subspaces of Rnusually occur in applications and theory in one of two ways. In both
cases, the subspace can be related to a matrix.
D E F I N I T I O N Thecolumn space of a matrix Ais the set Col Aof all linear combinations of the
columns of A.
IfADa1 an, with the columns in Rm, then Col Ais the same as
Spanfa1; : : : ; ang. Example 4 shows that the column space of an mnmatrix is a
subspace of Rm. Note that Col Aequals Rmonly when the columns of AspanRm.
Otherwise, Col Ais only part of Rm.

150 CHAPTER 2 Matrix Algebra
The solution of Example 4 shows that when a system of linear equations is written
in the form AxDb, the column space of Ais the set of all bfor which the system has
a solution.
D E F I N I T I O N Thenull space of a matrix Ais the set Nul Aof all solutions of the homogeneous
equation AxD0.
When Ahasncolumns, the solutions of AxD0belong to Rn, and the null space
ofAis a subset of Rn. In fact, Nul Ahas the properties of a subspace ofRn.
T H E O R E M 1 2 The null space of an mnmatrix Ais a subspace of Rn. Equivalently, the set of all
solutions of a system AxD0ofmhomogeneous linear equations in nunknowns
is a subspace of Rn.
PROOF The zero vector is in Nul A(because A0D0). To show that Nul Asatisﬁes the
other two properties required for a subspace, take any uandvin Nul A. That is, suppose
AuD0andAvD0. Then, by a property of matrix multiplication,
A.uCv/DAuCAvD0C0D0
Thus uCvsatisﬁes AxD0, and so uCvis in Nul A. Also, for any scalar c; A.c u/D
c.Au/Dc.0/D0, which shows that cuis in Nul A.
To test whether a given vector vis in Nul A, just compute Avto see whether Avis
the zero vector. Because Nul Ais described by a condition that must be checked for each
vector, we say that the null space is deﬁned implicitly . In contrast, the column space is
deﬁned explicitly , because vectors in Col Acan be constructed (by linear combinations)
from the columns of A. To create an explicit description of Nul A, solve the equation
AxD0and write the solution in parametric vector form. (See Example 6, below.)2
Basis for a Subspace
Because a subspace typically contains an inﬁnite number of vectors, some problems
involving a subspace are handled best by working with a small ﬁnite set of vectors that
span the subspace. The smaller the set, the better. It can be shown that the smallest
possible spanning set must be linearly independent.
D E F I N I T I O N Abasis for a subspace HofRnis a linearly independent set in Hthat spans H.
EXAMPLE 5 The columns of an invertible nnmatrix form a basis for all of Rn
because they are linearly independent and span Rn, by the Invertible Matrix Theorem.
One such matrix is the nnidentity matrix. Its columns are denoted by e1; : : : ; en:

Equation (1) shows that Nul Acoincides with the set of all linear combinations of u,
v;andw:That is, fu;v;wggenerates Nul A. In fact, this construction of u,v, and w
automatically makes them linearly independent, because equation (1) shows that 0D
x2uCx4vCx5wonly if the weights x2,x4, and x5are all zero. (Examine entries 2, 4,
and 5 in the vector x2uCx4vCx5w.) Sofu;v;wgis abasis for Nul A.
Finding a basis for the column space of a matrix is actually less work than ﬁnding
a basis for the null space. However, the method requires some explanation. Let’s begin
with a simple case.
EXAMPLE 7 Find a basis for the column space of the matrix

SOLUTION Denote the columns of Bbyb1; : : : ; b5and note that b3D  3b1C2b2and
b4D5b1 b2. The fact that b3andb4are combinations of the pivot columns means that
any combination of b1; : : : ; b5is actually just a combination of b1,b2, and b5. Indeed,
ifvis any vector in Col B, say,
vDc1b1Cc2b2Cc3b3Cc4b4Cc5b5
then, substituting for b3andb4, we can write vin the form
vDc1b1Cc2b2Cc3. 3b1C2b2/Cc4.5b1 b2/Cc5b5
which is a linear combination of b1,b2, and b5. Sofb1;b2;b5gspans Col B. Also, b1,
b2, and b5are linearly independent, because they are columns from an identity matrix.
So the pivot columns of Bform a basis for Col B.

152 CHAPTER 2 Matrix Algebra
The matrix Bin Example 7 is in reduced echelon form. To handle a general matrix
A, recall that linear dependence relations among the columns of Acan be expressed
in the form AxD0for some x. (If some columns are not involved in a particular
dependence relation, then the corresponding entries in xare zero.) When Ais row
reduced to echelon form B, the columns are drastically changed, but the equations
AxD0andBxD0have the same set of solutions. That is, the columns of Ahave
exactly the same linear dependence relationships as the columns of B.
EXAMPLE 8 It can be veriﬁed that the matrix
ADa1a2 a5D2

 2 2 2  8 2
2 3 0 7 1
3 4  1 11  83
775
is row equivalent to the matrix Bin Example 7. Find a basis for Col A.
SOLUTION From Example 7, the pivot columns of Aare columns 1, 2, and 5.
Also, b3D  3b1C2b2andb4D5b1 b2. Since row operations do not affect linear
dependence relations among the columns of the matrix, we should have
a3D  3a1C2a2and a4D5a1 a2
Check that this is true! By the argument in Example 7, a3anda4are not needed to
generate the column space of A. Also, fa1;a2;a5gmust be linearly independent, because
any dependence relation among a1,a2, and a5would imply the same dependence relation
among b1,b2, and b5. Since fb1;b2;b5gis linearly independent, fa1;a2;a5gis also
linearly independent and hence is a basis for Col A.
The argument in Example 8 can be adapted to prove the following theorem.
T H E O R E M 1 3 The pivot columns of a matrix Aform a basis for the column space of A.
Warning: Be careful to use pivot columns of Aitself for the basis of Col A. The
columns of an echelon form Bare often not in the column space of A. (For instance,
in Examples 7 and 8, the columns of Ball have zeros in their last entries and cannot
generate the columns of A.)

than testing whether a speciﬁed vector is in Nul A. However, since Ais already
in reduced echelon form, the equation AxD0shows that if xD.x1; x2; x3/;then
x2D0; x 3D0;andx1is a free variable. Thus, a basis for Nul AisvD.1; 0; 0/:
Finding just one vector in Col Ais trivial, since each column of Ais in Col A. In
this particular case, the same vector vis in both Nul AandColA. For most nn
matrices, the zero vector of Rnis the only vector in both Nul Aand Col A.
3.IfAis invertible, then the columns of AspanRn;by the Invertible Matrix Theorem.
By deﬁnition, the columns of any matrix always span the column space, so in this
case Col Ais all of Rn:In symbols, Col ADRn:Also, since Ais invertible, the
equation AxD0has only the trivial solution. This means that Nul Ais the zero

2.9 DIMENSION AND RANK
This section continues the discussion of subspaces and bases for subspaces, beginning
with the concept of a coordinate system. The deﬁnition and example below should make
a useful new term, dimension , seem quite natural, at least for subspaces of R3.
Coordinate Systems
The main reason for selecting a basis for a subspace H;instead of merely a spanning
set, is that each vector in Hcan be written in only one way as a linear combination of
the basis vectors. To see why, suppose BD fb1; : : : ; bpgis a basis for H, and suppose
a vector xinHcan be generated in two ways, say,
xDc1b1C  C cpbpand xDd1b1C  C dpbp (1)
Then, subtracting gives
0Dx xD.c1 d1/b1C  C .cp dp/bp (2)
SinceBis linearly independent, the weights in (2) must all be zero. That is, cjDdjfor
1jp;which shows that the two representations in (1) are actually the same.

2.9 Dimension and Rank 157
Notice that although points in Hare also in R3, they are completely determined
by their coordinate vectors, which belong to R2. The grid on the plane in Figure 1
makes H“look” like R2. The correspondence x7!xBis a one-to-one correspondence
between HandR2that preserves linear combinations. We call such a correspondence
anisomorphism , and we say that Hisisomorphic toR2.
In general, if BD fb1; : : : ; bpgis a basis for H, then the mapping x7!xBis a
one-to-one correspondence that makes Hlook and act the same as Rp(even though the
vectors in Hthemselves may have more than pentries). (Section 4.4 has more details.)
The Dimension of a Subspace
It can be shown that if a subspace Hhas a basis of pvectors, then every basis of Hmust
consist of exactly pvectors. (See Exercises 27 and 28.) Thus the following deﬁnition
makes sense.
D E F I N I T I O N The dimension of a nonzero subspace H, denoted by dim H, is the number of
vectors in any basis for H. The dimension of the zero subspace f0gis deﬁned to
be zero.2
The space Rnhas dimension n. Every basis for Rnconsists of nvectors. A plane
through 0inR3is two-dimensional, and a line through 0is one-dimensional.
EXAMPLE 2 Recall that the null space of the matrix Ain Example 6 in Section 2.8
had a basis of 3 vectors. So the dimension of Nul Ain this case is 3. Observe how each
basis vector corresponds to a free variable in the equation AxD0. Our construction
always produces a basis in this way. So, to ﬁnd the dimension of Nul A, simply identify
and count the number of free variables in AxD0.
D E F I N I T I O N Therank of a matrix A, denoted by rank A, is the dimension of the column space
ofA.
Since the pivot columns of Aform a basis for Col A, the rank of Ais just the number
of pivot columns in A.

158 CHAPTER 2 Matrix Algebra
The row reduction in Example 3 reveals that there are two free variables in AxD0,
because two of the ﬁve columns of Aarenotpivot columns. (The nonpivot columns
correspond to the free variables in AxD0.) Since the number of pivot columns plus the
number of nonpivot columns is exactly the number of columns, the dimensions of Col A
and Nul Ahave the following useful connection. (See the Rank Theorem in Section 4.6
for additional details.)
T H E O R E M 1 4 The Rank Theorem
If a matrix Ahasncolumns, then rank ACdim Nul ADn.
The following theorem is important for applications and will be needed in
Chapters 5 and 6. The theorem (proved in Section 4.5) is certainly plausible, if you
think of a p-dimensional subspace as isomorphic to Rp. The Invertible Matrix Theorem
shows that pvectors in Rpare linearly independent if and only if they also span Rp.
T H E O R E M 1 5 The Basis Theorem
LetHbe ap-dimensional subspace of Rn:Any linearly independent set of exactly
pelements in His automatically a basis for H:Also, any set of pelements of H
that spans His automatically a basis for H:
Rank and the Invertible Matrix Theorem
The various vector space concepts associated with a matrix provide several more
statements for the Invertible Matrix Theorem. They are presented below to follow the
statements in the original theorem in Section 2.3.
T H E O R E M The Invertible Matrix Theorem (continued)
LetAbe an nnmatrix. Then the following statements are each equivalent to
the statement that Ais an invertible matrix.
m.The columns of Aform a basis of Rn:
n.ColADRn
o.dim Col ADn
p.rankADn
q.NulAD f0g
r.dim Nul AD0
PROOF Statement (m) is logically equivalent to statements (e) and (h) regarding linear
independence and spanning. The other ﬁve statements are linked to the earlier ones of
the theorem by the following chain of almost trivial implications:
(g))(n))(o))(p))(r))(q))(d)
Statement (g), which says that the equation AxDbhas at least one solution for each
binRn, implies statement (n), because Col Ais precisely the set of all bsuch that
the equation AxDbis consistent. The implications (n) )(o))(p) follow from the
deﬁnitions of dimension andrank. If the rank of Aisn, the number of columns of A,
then dim Nul AD0, by the Rank Theorem, and so Nul AD f0g. Thus (p) )(r))(q).
SECOND REVISED PAGES


--- Page 176 ---
2.9 Dimension and Rank 159
Also, statement (q) implies that the equation AxD0has only the trivial solution, which
is statement (d). Since statements (d) and (g) are already known to be equivalent to the
statement that Ais invertible, the proof is complete.

Many algorithms discussed in this text are useful for understanding concepts
and making simple computations by hand. However, the algorithms are often
unsuitable for large-scale problems in real life.
Rank determination is a good example. It would seem easy to reduce a matrix
to echelon form and count the pivots. But unless exact arithmetic is performed
on a matrix whose entries are speciﬁed exactly, row operations can change the
apparent rank of a matrix. For instance, if the value of xin the matrix5 7
5 x
is not stored exactly as 7 in a computer, then the rank may be 1 or 2, depending
on whether the computer treats x 7as zero.
In practical applications, the effective rank of a matrix Ais often determined
from the singular value decomposition of A, to be discussed in Section 7.4.

INTRODUCTORY EXAMPLE
Random Paths and Distortion
In his autobiographical book, Surely You’re Joking,
Mr. Feynman , the Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard
Feynman tells of observing ants in his Princeton graduate
school apartment. He studied the ants’ behavior by pro-
viding paper ferries to sugar suspended on a string where
the ants would not accidentally ﬁnd it. When an ant would
step onto a paper ferry, Feynman would transport the ant
to the food and then back. After the ants learned to use
the ferry, he relocated the return landing. The colony soon
confused the outbound and return ferry landings, indicating
that their “learning” consisted of creating and following
trails. Feynman conﬁrmed this conjecture by laying glass
slides on the ﬂoor. Once the ants established trails on the
glass slides, he rearranged the slides and therefore the
trails on them. The ants followed the repositioned trails
and Feynman could direct the ants where he wished.
Suppose Feynman had decided to conduct additional
investigations using a globe built of wire mesh on which
an ant must follow individual wires and choose between
going left and right at each intersection. If several ants and
an equal number of food sources are placed on the globe,
how likely is it that each ant would ﬁnd its own food source
rather than encountering another ant’s trail and following
it to a shared resource?1
1The solution to the ant-path problem (and two other applications) can
be found in a June 2005 Mathematical Monthly article by Arthur
Benjamin and Naomi Cameron.In order to record the actual routes of the ants and to
communicate the results to others, it is convenient to use
a rectangular map of the globe. There are many ways to
create such maps. One simple way is to use the longitude
and latitude on the globe as xandycoordinates on the map.
As is the case with all maps, the result is not a faithful
representation of the globe. Features near the “equator”
look much the same on the globe and the map, but regions
near the “poles” of the globe are distorted. Images of polar
regions are much larger than the images of similar sized
regions near the equator. To ﬁt in with its surroundings on
the map, the image of an ant near one of the poles should
be larger than one near the equator. How much larger?
Surprisingly, both the ant-path and the area distortion
problems are best answered through the use of the deter-
minant, the subject of this chapter. Indeed, the determinant
has so many uses that a summary of the applications known
in the early 1900’s ﬁlled a four-volume treatise by Thomas
Muir. With changes in emphasis and the greatly increased
sizes of the matrices used in modern applications, many
uses that were important then are no longer critical today.
Nevertheless, the determinant still plays an important role.

166 CHAPTER 3 Determinants
Beyond introducing the determinant in Section 3.1, this chapter presents two important
ideas. Section 3.2 derives an invertibility criterion for a square matrix that plays a pivotal
role in Chapter 5. Section 3.3 shows how the determinant measures the amount by which
a linear transformation changes the area of a ﬁgure. When applied locally, this technique
answers the question of a map’s expansion rate near the poles. This idea plays a critical
role in multivariable calculus in the form of the Jacobian.
3.1 INTRODUCTION TO DETERMINANTS
Recall from Section 2.2 that a 22matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant
is nonzero. To extend this useful fact to larger matrices, we need a deﬁnition for the
determinant of an nnmatrix. We can discover the deﬁnition for the 33case by
watching what happens when an invertible 33matrix Ais row reduced.
Consider ADaijwith a11¤0. If we multiply the second and third rows of Aby
a11and then subtract appropriate multiples of the ﬁrst row from the other two rows, we
ﬁnd that Ais row equivalent to the following two matrices:
2
4a11 a12 a13
a11a21a11a22a11a23
a11a31a11a32a11a333

4a11 a12 a13
0 a 11a22 a12a21a11a23 a13a21
0 a 11a32 a12a31a11a33 a13a313
5 (1)
Since Ais invertible, either the .2; 2/ -entry or the .3; 2/ -entry on the right in (1) is
nonzero. Let us suppose that the .2; 2/ -entry is nonzero. (Otherwise, we can make a
row interchange before proceeding.) Multiply row 3 by a11a22 a12a21, and then to the
new row 3 add  .a11a32 a12a31/times row 2. This will show that

4a11 a12 a13
0 a 11a22 a12a21 a11a23 a13a21

where
Da11a22a33Ca12a23a31Ca13a21a32 a11a23a32 a12a21a33 a13a22a31(2)
Since Ais invertible, must be nonzero. The converse is true, too, as we will see in
Section 3.2. We call in (2) the determinant of the 33matrix A.
Recall that the determinant of a 22matrix, ADaij, is the number
detADa11a22 a12a21
For a 11matrix—say, ADa11—we deﬁne det ADa11. To generalize the deﬁni-
tion of the determinant to larger matrices, we’ll use 22determinants to rewrite the
33determinant described above. Since the terms in can be grouped as
.a11a22a33 a11a23a32/ .a12a21a33 a12a23a31/C.a13a21a32 a13a22a31/,

a32 a33
 a12deta21 a23

Ca13deta21 a22

For brevity, write
Da11detA11 a12detA12Ca13detA13 (3)
where A11,A12, and A13are obtained from Aby deleting the ﬁrst row and one of the
three columns. For any square matrix A, letAijdenote the submatrix formed by deleting

We can now give a recursive deﬁnition of a determinant. When nD3, detAis deﬁned
using determinants of the 22submatrices A1j, as in (3) above. When nD4, detA
uses determinants of the 33submatrices A1j. In general, an nndeterminant is
deﬁned by determinants of .n 1/.n 1/submatrices.
D E F I N I T I O N Forn2, the determinant of an nnmatrix ADaijis the sum of nterms
of the form a1jdetA1j, with plus and minus signs alternating, where the entries

168 CHAPTER 3 Determinants
This formula is called a cofactor expansion across the ﬁrst row ofA. We omit the
proof of the following fundamental theorem to avoid a lengthy digression.
T H E O R E M 1 The determinant of an nnmatrix Acan be computed by a cofactor expansion
across any row or down any column. The expansion across the ith row using the
cofactors in (4) is

Theorem 1 is helpful for computing the determinant of a matrix that contains many
zeros. For example, if a row is mostly zeros, then the cofactor expansion across that row
has many terms that are zero, and the cofactors in those terms need not be calculated.
The same approach works with a column that contains many zeros.

3.1 Introduction to Determinants 169
Henceforth we will omit the zero terms in the cofactor expansion. Next, expand this
44determinant down the ﬁrst column, in order to take advantage of the zeros there.
We have

This 33determinant was computed in Example 1 and found to equal  2. Hence
detAD32. 2/D  12.
The matrix in Example 3 was nearly triangular. The method in that example is easily
adapted to prove the following theorem.
T H E O R E M 2 IfAis a triangular matrix, then det Ais the product of the entries on the main
diagonal of A.
The strategy in Example 3 of looking for zeros works extremely well when an entire
row or column consists of zeros. In such a case, the cofactor expansion along such a row
or column is a sum of zeros! So the determinant is zero. Unfortunately, most cofactor
expansions are not so quickly evaluated.
N U M E R I C A L N O T E
By today’s standards, a 2525matrix is small. Yet it would be impossible
to calculate a 2525determinant by cofactor expansion. In general, a cofac-
tor expansion requires more than nmultiplications, and 25is approximately
1:51025.
If a computer performs one trillion multiplications per second, it would have
to run for more than 500,000 years to compute a 2525determinant by this
method. Fortunately, there are faster methods, as we’ll soon discover.
Exercises 19–38 explore important properties of determinants, mostly for the 22
case. The results from Exercises 33–36 will be used in the next section to derive the
analogous properties for nnmatrices.

det.2A/ , and det .10A/ . Repeat with two other random 44
integer matrices, and make conjectures about how these de-
terminants are related. (Refer to Exercise 36 in Section 2.1.)
Then check your conjectures with several random 55and
66integer matrices. Modify your conjectures, if necessary,
and report your results.
SOLUTION TO PRACTICE PROBLEM
Take advantage of the zeros. Begin with a cofactor expansion down the third column to
obtain a 33matrix, which may be evaluated by an expansion down its ﬁrst column.

3.2 PROPERTIES OF DETERMINANTS
The secret of determinants lies in how they change when row operations are performed.
The following theorem generalizes the results of Exercises 19–24 in Section 3.1. The
proof is at the end of this section.

The following examples show how to use Theorem 3 to ﬁnd determinants
efﬁciently.
EXAMPLE 1 Compute det A, where AD2

 2 8  9
 1 7 03
5.
SOLUTION The strategy is to reduce Ato echelon form and then to use the fact that the
determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of the diagonal entries. The ﬁrst two
row replacements in column 1 do not change the determinant:
detAD1 4 2
 2 8  9
 1 7 0D1 4 2
0 0  5

0 0  5
0 3 2
An interchange of rows 2 and 3 reverses the sign of the determinant, so
detAD  1 4 2
0 3 2
0 0  5D  .1/.3/.  5/D15
A common use of Theorem 3(c) in hand calculations is to factor out a common
multiple of one row of a matrix. For instance,
  
5k 2k 3k
  Dk  
5 2 3

where the starred entries are unchanged. We use this step in the next example.
EXAMPLE 2 Compute det A, where AD2
6642 8 6 8
3 9 5 10
 3 0 1  2
1 4 0 63
775.
SOLUTION To simplify the arithmetic, we want a 1 in the upper-left corner. We could
interchange rows 1 and 4. Instead, we factor out 2 from the top row, and then proceed
with row replacements in the ﬁrst column:
detAD21 4 3 4
3 9 5 10
 3 0 1  2

0 3  4 2
0 12 10 10
0 0  3 2
Next, we could factor out another 2 from row 3 or use the 3 in the second column as a
pivot. We choose the latter operation, adding 4 times row 2 to row 3:
detAD21 4 3 4
0 3  4 2
0 0  6 2
0 0  3 2
Finally, adding  1=2times row 3 to row 4, and computing the “triangular” determinant,
we ﬁnd that
detAD21 4 3 4

detAD. 1/rdetU
Since Uis in echelon form, it is triangular, and so det Uis the product of the
diagonal entries u11; : : : ; u nn. IfAis invertible, the entries uiiare all pivots (because
AInand the uiihave not been scaled to 1’s). Otherwise, at least unnis zero, and the

It is interesting to note that although the echelon form Udescribed above is not unique
(because it is not completely row reduced), and the pivots are not unique, the product
of the pivots isunique, except for a possible minus sign.
Formula (1) not only gives a concrete interpretation of det Abut also proves the
main theorem of this section:
T H E O R E M 4 A square matrix Ais invertible if and only if det A¤0.
Theorem 4 adds the statement “det A¤0” to the Invertible Matrix Theorem. A
useful corollary is that det AD0when the columns of Aare linearly dependent. Also,
detAD0when the rows ofAare linearly dependent. (Rows of Aare columns of AT,
and linearly dependent columns of ATmake ATsingular. When ATis singular, so is A,
by the Invertible Matrix Theorem.) In practice, linear dependence is obvious when two
columns or two rows are the same or a column or a row is zero.

1.Most computer programs that compute det Afor a general matrix Ause the
method of formula (1) above.
2.It can be shown that evaluation of an nndeterminant using row operations
requires about 2n3=3arithmetic operations. Any modern microcomputer can
calculate a 2525determinant in a fraction of a second, since only about
10,000 operations are required.

174 CHAPTER 3 Determinants
Computers can also handle large “sparse” matrices, with special routines that take
advantage of the presence of many zeros. Of course, zero entries can speed hand compu-
tations, too. The calculations in the next example combine the power of row operations
with the strategy from Section 3.1 of using zero entries in cofactor expansions.

775.
SOLUTION A good way to begin is to use the 2 in column 1 as a pivot, eliminating
the 2below it. Then use a cofactor expansion to reduce the size of the determinant,
followed by another row replacement operation. Thus
detAD0 1 2  1

An interchange of rows 2 and 3 would produce a “triangular determinant.” Another
approach is to make a cofactor expansion down the ﬁrst column:

 3 1D  2.15/D  30
Column Operations
We can perform operations on the columns of a matrix in a way that is analogous to the
row operations we have considered. The next theorem shows that column operations
have the same effects on determinants as row operations.
Remark: The Principle of Mathematical Induction says the following: Let P.n/ be a
statement that is either true or false for each natural number n. Then P.n/ is true for all
n1provided that P.1/ is true, and for each natural number k, ifP.k/ is true, then
P.kC1/is true. The Principle of Mathematical Induction is used to prove the next
theorem.
T H E O R E M 5 IfAis an nnmatrix, then det ATDdetA.
PROOF The theorem is obvious for nD1. Suppose the theorem is true for kk
determinants and let nDkC1. Then the cofactor of a1jinAequals the cofactor
ofaj1inAT, because the cofactors involve kkdeterminants. Hence the cofactor
expansion of det Aalong the ﬁrst rowequals the cofactor expansion of det ATdown the
ﬁrstcolumn . That is, AandAThave equal determinants. The theorem is true for nD1,
and the truth of the theorem for one value of nimplies its truth for the next value of n.
By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the theorem is true for all n1.
Because of Theorem 5, each statement in Theorem 3 is true when the word rowis
replaced everywhere by column . To verify this property, one merely applies the original
Theorem 3 to AT. A row operation on ATamounts to a column operation on A.
Column operations are useful for both theoretical purposes and hand computations.
However, for simplicity we’ll perform only row operations in numerical calculations.

Warning: A common misconception is that Theorem 6 has an analogue for sums of
matrices. However, det .ACB/isnotequal to det ACdetB, in general.
A Linearity Property of the Determinant Function
For an nnmatrix A, we can consider det Aas a function of the ncolumn vectors in
A. We will show that if all columns except one are held ﬁxed, then det Ais alinear
function of that one (vector) variable.
Suppose that the jth column of Ais allowed to vary, and write
ADa1   aj 1 x a jC1   an
Deﬁne a transformation TfromRntoRby
T .x/Ddeta1   aj 1 x a jC1   an
Then,
T .cx/DcT .x/for all scalars cand all xinRn(2)
T .uCv/DT .u/CT .v/for all u,vinRn(3)
Property (2) is Theorem 3(c) applied to the columns of A. A proof of property (3)
follows from a cofactor expansion of det Adown the jth column. (See Exercise 43.)
This (multi-) linearity property of the determinant turns out to have many useful conse-
quences that are studied in more advanced courses.
Proofs of Theorems 3and 6
It is convenient to prove Theorem 3 when it is stated in terms of the elementary matrices
discussed in Section 2.2. We call an elementary matrix Earow replacement (matrix ) if
Eis obtained from the identity Iby adding a multiple of one row to another row; Eis
aninterchange ifEis obtained by interchanging two rows of I; and Eisa scale by r
ifEis obtained by multiplying a row of Iby a nonzero scalar r. With this terminology,
Theorem 3 can be reformulated as follows:

PROOF OF THEOREM 3 The proof is by induction on the size of A. The case of a
22matrix was veriﬁed in Exercises 33–36 of Section 3.1. Suppose the theorem has
been veriﬁed for determinants of kkmatrices with k2, letnDkC1, and let A
benn. The action of EonAinvolves either two rows or only one row. So we can
expand det EAacross a row that is unchanged by the action of E, say, row i. Let
Aij(respectively, Bij/be the matrix obtained by deleting row iand column jfrom
A(respectively, EA). Then the rows of Bijare obtained from the rows of Aijby the
same type of elementary row operation that Eperforms on A. Since these submatrices
are only kk, the induction assumption implies that
detBijDdetAij
where D1, 1, orr, depending on the nature of E. The cofactor expansion across
rowiis
detEADai1. 1/iC1detBi1C    C ain. 1/iCndetBin
Dai1. 1/iC1detAi1C    C ain. 1/iCndetAin
DdetA
In particular, taking ADIn, we see that det ED1, 1, orr, depending on the nature
ofE. Thus the theorem is true for nD2, and the truth of the theorem for one value of n
implies its truth for the next value of n. By the principle of induction, the theorem must
be true for n2. The theorem is trivially true for nD1.
PROOF OF THEOREM 6 IfAis not invertible, then neither is AB, by Exercise 27
in Section 2.3. In this case, det ABD.detA/.detB/, because both sides are zero, by
Theorem 4. If Ais invertible, then Aand the identity matrix Inare row equivalent by
the Invertible Matrix Theorem. So there exist elementary matrices E1; : : : ; E psuch that

3.3 CRAMER'S RULE, VOLUME, AND LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
This section applies the theory of the preceding sections to obtain important theoretical
formulas and a geometric interpretation of the determinant.
Cramer’s Rule
Cramer’s rule is needed in a variety of theoretical calculations. For instance, it can be
used to study how the solution of AxDbis affected by changes in the entries of b.
However, the formula is inefﬁcient for hand calculations, except for 22or perhaps
33matrices.
For any nnmatrix Aand any binRn, letAi.b/be the matrix obtained from A
by replacing column iby the vector b.

Application to Engineering
A number of important engineering problems, particularly in electrical engineering and
control theory, can be analyzed by Laplace transforms . This approach converts an ap-
propriate system of linear differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equa-
tions whose coefﬁcients involve a parameter. The next example illustrates the type of
algebraic system that may arise.

A Formula for A–1
Cramer’s rule leads easily to a general formula for the inverse of an nnmatrix A. The
jth column of A 1is a vector xthat satisﬁes

where ejis the jth column of the identity matrix, and the ith entry of xis the .i; j / -entry
ofA 1. By Cramer’s rule,

where Cjiis a cofactor of A. By (2), the .i; j / -entry of A 1is the cofactor Cjidivided
by det A. [Note that the subscripts on Cjiare the reverse of .i; j / .] Thus

Theorem 8 is useful mainly for theoretical calculations. The formula for A 1
permits one to deduce properties of the inverse without actually calculating it.
Except for special cases, the algorithm in Section 2.2 gives a much better way to
compute A 1, if the inverse is really needed.
Cramer’s rule is also a theoretical tool. It can be used to study how sensitive
the solution of AxDbis to changes in an entry in bor in A(perhaps due
to experimental error when acquiring the entries for borA). When Ais a
33matrix with complex entries, Cramer’s rule is sometimes selected for hand
computation because row reduction of Abwith complex arithmetic can be
messy, and the determinants are fairly easy to compute. For a larger nnmatrix
(real or complex), Cramer’s rule is hopelessly inefﬁcient. Computing just one
determinant takes about as much work as solving AxDbby row reduction.
Determinants as Area or Volume
In the next application, we verify the geometric interpretation of determinants described
in the chapter introduction. Although a general discussion of length and distance in Rn
will not be given until Chapter 6, we assume here that the usual Euclidean concepts of
length, area, and volume are already understood for R2andR3.
T H E O R E M 9 IfAis a22matrix, the area of the parallelogram determined by the columns of
AisjdetAj. IfAis a33matrix, the volume of the parallelepiped determined

parallelogram nor jdetAj. From Section 3.2, we know that the absolute value of the
determinant is unchanged when two columns are interchanged or a multiple of one
column is added to another. And it is easy to see that such operations sufﬁce to transform
Ainto a diagonal matrix. Column interchanges do not change the parallelogram at all.
So it sufﬁces to prove the following simple geometric observation that applies to vectors
inR2orR3:

Leta1anda2be nonzero vectors. Then for any scalar c, the area of the parallelo-
gram determined by a1anda2equals the area of the parallelogram determined by
a1anda2Cca1.
To prove this statement, we may assume that a2is not a multiple of a1, for other-
wise the two parallelograms would be degenerate and have zero area. If Lis the line
through 0anda1, then a2CLis the line through a2parallel to L, and a2Cca1is on
this line. See Figure 2. The points a2anda2Cca1have the same perpendicular distance
toL. Hence the two parallelograms in Figure 2 have the same area, since they share the
base from 0toa1. This completes the proof for R2.

FIGURE 2 Two parallelograms of equal area.
The proof for R3is similar. The theorem is obviously true for a 33diagonal
matrix. See Figure 3. And any 33matrix Acan be transformed into a diagonal matrix
using column operations that do not change jdetAj. (Think about doing row operations
onAT.) So it sufﬁces to show that these operations do not affect the volume of the
parallelepiped determined by the columns of A.

Its volume is the area of the base in the plane Span fa1;a3gtimes the altitude of a2
above Span fa1;a3g. Any vector a2Cca1has the same altitude because a2Cca1lies
in the plane a2CSpanfa1;a3g, which is parallel to Span fa1;a3g. Hence the volume of
the parallelepiped is unchanged when a1a2a3is changed to a1a2Cca1a3.
Thus a column replacement operation does not affect the volume of the parallelepiped.
Since column interchanges have no effect on the volume, the proof is complete.

Linear Transformations
Determinants can be used to describe an important geometric property of linear trans-
formations in the plane and in R3. IfTis a linear transformation and Sis a set in the
domain of T, letT .S/ denote the set of images of points in S. We are interested in how
the area (or volume) of T .S/ compares with the area (or volume) of the original set S.
For convenience, when Sis a region bounded by a parallelogram, we also refer to Sas
a parallelogram.

An arbitrary parallelogram has the form pCS, where pis a vector and Sis a parallelo-

This shows that (5) holds for all parallelograms in R2. The proof of (6) for the 33
case is analogous.
When we attempt to generalize Theorem 10 to a region in R2orR3that is not
bounded by straight lines or planes, we must face the problem of how to deﬁne and
compute its area or volume. This is a question studied in calculus, and we shall only
outline the basic idea for R2. IfRis a planar region that has a ﬁnite area, then Rcan
be approximated by a grid of small squares that lie inside R. By making the squares
sufﬁciently small, the area of Rmay be approximated as closely as desired by the sum
of the areas of the small squares. See Figure 6.
0 0
FIGURE 6 Approximating a planar region by a union of squares.
The approximation improves as the grid becomes ﬁner.
IfTis a linear transformation associated with a 22matrix A, then the image of
a planar region Runder Tis approximated by the images of the small squares inside
R. The proof of Theorem 10 shows that each such image is a parallelogram whose area
isjdetAjtimes the area of the square. If R0is the union of the squares inside R, then
the area of T .R0/isjdetAjtimes the area of R0. See Figure 7. Also, the area of T .R0/
is close to the area of T .R/ . An argument involving a limiting process may be given to
justify the following generalization of Theorem 10.

INTRODUCTORY EXAMPLE
Space Flight and Control Systems
Twelve stories high and weighing 75 tons, Columbia rose
majestically off the launching pad on a cool Palm Sunday
morning in April 1981. A product of ten years’ intensive
research and development, the ﬁrst U.S. space shuttle was a
triumph of control systems engineering design, involving
many branches of engineering—aeronautical, chemical,
electrical, hydraulic, and mechanical.
The space shuttle’s control systems are absolutely
critical for ﬂight. Because the shuttle is an unstable
airframe, it requires constant computer monitoring during
atmospheric ﬂight. The ﬂight control system sends a stream
of commands to aerodynamic control surfaces and 44 small
thruster jets. Figure 1 shows a typical closed-loop feedback
system that controls the pitch of the shuttle during ﬂight.(The pitch is the elevation angle of the nose cone.) The
junction symbols ( 
) show where signals from various
sensors are added to the computer signals ﬂowing along
the top of the ﬁgure.
Mathematically, the input and output signals to an
engineering system are functions. It is important in
applications that these functions can be added, as in
Figure 1, and multiplied by scalars. These two operations
on functions have algebraic properties that are completely
analogous to the operations of adding vectors in Rn
and multiplying a vector by a scalar, as we shall see
in Sections 4.1 and 4.8. For this reason, the set of all
possible inputs (functions) is called a vector space . The
mathematical foundation for systems engineering rests

192 CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
on vector spaces of functions, and Chapter 4 extends the
theory of vectors in Rnto include such functions. Later on,you will see how other vector spaces arise in engineering,
physics, and statistics.
WEB
The mathematical seeds planted in Chapters 1 and 2 germinate and begin to blossom
in this chapter. The beauty and power of linear algebra will be seen more clearly when
you view Rnas only one of a variety of vector spaces that arise naturally in applied
problems. Actually, a study of vector spaces is not much different from a study of Rn
itself, because you can use your geometric experience with R2andR3to visualize many
general concepts.
Beginning with basic deﬁnitions in Section 4.1, the general vector space framework
develops gradually throughout the chapter. A goal of Sections 4.3–4.5 is to demonstrate
how closely other vector spaces resemble Rn. Section 4.6 on rank is one of the high
points of the chapter, using vector space terminology to tie together important facts about
rectangular matrices. Section 4.8 applies the theory of the chapter to discrete signals and
difference equations used in digital control systems such as in the space shuttle. Markov
chains, in Section 4.9, provide a change of pace from the more theoretical sections of
the chapter and make good examples for concepts to be introduced in Chapter 5.
4.1 VECTOR SPACES AND SUBSPACES
Much of the theory in Chapters 1 and 2 rested on certain simple and obvious alge-
braic properties of Rn, listed in Section 1.3. In fact, many other mathematical systems
have the same properties. The speciﬁc properties of interest are listed in the following
deﬁnition.
D E F I N I T I O N Avector space is a nonempty set Vof objects, called vectors , on which are de-
ﬁned two operations, called addition andmultiplication by scalars (real numbers),
subject to the ten axioms (or rules) listed below.1The axioms must hold for all
vectors u,v, and winVand for all scalars candd.
1.The sum of uandv, denoted by uCv, is in V.
2.uCvDvCu.
3..uCv/CwDuC.vCw/.
4.There is a zero vector 0inVsuch that uC0Du.
5.For each uinV, there is a vector  uinVsuch that uC. u/D0.
6.The scalar multiple of ubyc, denoted by cu, is in V.
7.c.uCv/DcuCcv.
8..cCd/uDcuCdu.
9.c.du/D.cd/ u.
10.1uDu.
1Technically, Vis areal vector space . All of the theory in this chapter also holds for a complex vector space
in which the scalars are complex numbers. We will look at this brieﬂy in Chapter 5. Until then, all scalars are
assumed to be real.

4.1 Vector Spaces and Subspaces 193
Using only these axioms, one can show that the zero vector in Axiom 4 is unique,
and the vector  u, called the negative ofu, in Axiom 5 is unique for each uinV.
See Exercises 25 and 26. Proofs of the following simple facts are also outlined in the
exercises:
For each uinVand scalar c,
0uD0 (1)
c0D0 (2)
 uD. 1/u (3)
EXAMPLE 1 The spaces Rn, where n1, are the premier examples of vector
spaces. The geometric intuition developed for R3will help you understand and visualize
many concepts throughout the chapter.
EXAMPLE 2 LetVbe the set of all arrows (directed line segments) in three-
dimensional space, with two arrows regarded as equal if they have the same length and
point in the same direction. Deﬁne addition by the parallelogram rule (from Section 1.3),
and for each vinV, deﬁne cvto be the arrow whose length is jcjtimes the length of
v, pointing in the same direction as vifc0and otherwise pointing in the opposite
direction. (See Figure 1.) Show that Vis a vector space. This space is a common model
in physical problems for various forces.

represents the zero vector. The negative of vis. 1/v. So Axioms 1, 4, 5, 6, and 10 are
evident. The rest are veriﬁed by geometry. For instance, see Figures 2 and 3.

written in a row rather than a column):

Iff´kgis another element of S, then the sum fykg C f´kgis the sequence fykC´kg
formed by adding corresponding terms of fykgandf´kg. The scalar multiple cfykgis
the sequence fcykg. The vector space axioms are veriﬁed in the same way as for Rn.
Elements of Sarise in engineering, for example, whenever a signal is measured (or
sampled) at discrete times. A signal might be electrical, mechanical, optical, and so on.
The major control systems for the space shuttle, mentioned in the chapter introduction,
use discrete (or digital) signals. For convenience, we will call Sthe space of (discrete-
time) signals . A signal may be visualized by a graph as in Figure 4.

EXAMPLE 4 Forn0, the set Pnof polynomials of degree at most nconsists of
all polynomials of the form

where the coefﬁcients a0; : : : ; a nand the variable tare real numbers. The degree of

degree of pis zero. If all the coefﬁcients are zero, pis called the zero polynomial . The
zero polynomial is included in Pneven though its degree, for technical reasons, is not
deﬁned.

The scalar multiple cpis the polynomial deﬁned by

These deﬁnitions satisfy Axioms 1 and 6 because pCqandcpare polynomials
of degree less than or equal to n. Axioms 2, 3, and 7–10 follow from properties of the
real numbers. Clearly, the zero polynomial acts as the zero vector in Axiom 4. Finally,
. 1/pacts as the negative of p, so Axiom 5 is satisﬁed. Thus Pnis a vector space.
The vector spaces Pnfor various nare used, for instance, in statistical trend analysis
of data, discussed in Section 6.8.
EXAMPLE 5 LetVbe the set of all real-valued functions deﬁned on a set D. (Typi-
cally,Dis the set of real numbers or some interval on the real line.) Functions are added
in the usual way: fCgis the function whose value at tin the domain Disf.t/Cg.t/.
Likewise, for a scalar cand an finV, the scalar multiple cfis the function whose value
attiscf.t/. For instance, if DDR,f.t/D1Csin2t, and g.t/D2C:5t, then
.fCg/.t/D3Csin2tC:5t and .2g/.t/D4Ct
Two functions in Vare equal if and only if their values are equal for every tin
D. Hence the zero vector in Vis the function that is identically zero, f.t/D0for all t,
and the negative of fis. 1/f. Axioms 1 and 6 are obviously true, and the other axioms
follow from properties of the real numbers, so Vis a vector space.
It is important to think of each function in the vector space Vof Example 5 as a
single object, as just one “point” or vector in the vector space. The sum of two vectors f
andg(functions in V, or elements of anyvector space) can be visualized as in Figure 5,
because this can help you carry over to a general vector space the geometric intuition
you have developed while working with the vector space Rn. See the Study Guide for
help as you learn to adopt this more general point of view.

4.1 Vector Spaces and Subspaces 195
Subspaces
In many problems, a vector space consists of an appropriate subset of vectors from some
larger vector space. In this case, only three of the ten vector space axioms need to be
checked; the rest are automatically satisﬁed.
D E F I N I T I O N Asubspace of a vector space Vis a subset HofVthat has three properties:
a.The zero vector of Vis inH.2
b.His closed under vector addition. That is, for each uandvinH, the sum
uCvis inH.
c.His closed under multiplication by scalars. That is, for each uinHand each
scalar c, the vector cuis inH.
Properties (a), (b), and (c) guarantee that a subspace HofVis itself a vector
space , under the vector space operations already deﬁned in V. To verify this, note
that properties (a), (b), and (c) are Axioms 1, 4, and 6. Axioms 2, 3, and 7–10 are
automatically true in Hbecause they apply to all elements of V, including those in H.
Axiom 5 is also true in H, because if uis inH, then . 1/uis inHby property (c), and
we know from equation (3) earlier in this section that . 1/uis the vector  uin Axiom 5.
So every subspace is a vector space. Conversely, every vector space is a subspace
(of itself and possibly of other larger spaces). The term subspace is used when at least
two vector spaces are in mind, with one inside the other, and the phrase subspace of V
identiﬁes Vas the larger space. (See Figure 6.)

VFIGURE 6
A subspace of V.
EXAMPLE 6 The set consisting of only the zero vector in a vector space Vis a
subspace of V, called the zero subspace and written as f0g.
EXAMPLE 7 LetPbe the set of all polynomials with real coefﬁcients, with opera-
tions in Pdeﬁned as for functions. Then Pis a subspace of the space of all real-valued
functions deﬁned on R. Also, for each n0,Pnis a subspace of P, because Pnis a
subset of Pthat contains the zero polynomial, the sum of two polynomials in Pnis also
inPn, and a scalar multiple of a polynomial in Pnis also in Pn.
EXAMPLE 8 The vector space R2isnota subspace of R3because R2is not even a
subset of R3. (The vectors in R3all have three entries, whereas the vectors in R2have
only two.) The set

is a subset of R3that “looks” and “acts” like R2, although it is logically distinct from
R2. See Figure 7. Show that His a subspace of R3.

SOLUTION The zero vector is in H, and His closed under vector addition and scalar
multiplication because these operations on vectors in Halways produce vectors whose
third entries are zero (and so belong to H/. Thus His a subspace of R3.
2Some texts replace property (a) in this deﬁnition by the assumption that His nonempty. Then (a) could be
deduced from (c) and the fact that 0uD0. But the best way to test for a subspace is to look ﬁrst for the zero
vector. If 0is inH, then properties (b) and (c) must be checked. If 0isnotinH, then Hcannot be a
subspace and the other properties need not be checked.

EXAMPLE 9 A plane in R3notthrough the origin is not a subspace of R3, because
the plane does not contain the zero vector of R3. Similarly, a line in R2notthrough the

A line that is not a vector space.origin, such as in Figure 8, is nota subspace of R2.
A Subspace Spanned by a Set
The next example illustrates one of the most common ways of describing a subspace.
As in Chapter 1, the term linear combination refers to any sum of scalar multiples of
vectors, and Span fv1; : : : ; vpgdenotes the set of all vectors that can be written as linear
combinations of v1; : : : ; vp.
EXAMPLE 10 Given v1andv2in a vector space V, letHDSpanfv1;v2g. Show
thatHis a subspace of V.
SOLUTION The zero vector is in H, since 0D0v1C0v2. To show that His closed
under vector addition, take two arbitrary vectors in H, say,
uDs1v1Cs2v2and wDt1v1Ct2v2
By Axioms 2, 3, and 8 for the vector space V,
uCwD.s1v1Cs2v2/C.t1v1Ct2v2/
D.s1Ct1/v1C.s2Ct2/v2
SouCwis inH. Furthermore, if cis any scalar, then by Axioms 7 and 9,
cuDc.s1v1Cs2v2/D.cs1/v1C.cs2/v2
which shows that cuis inHandHis closed under scalar multiplication. Thus His a
subspace of V.
In Section 4.5, you will see that every nonzero subspace of R3, other than R3itself,
is either Span fv1,v2gfor some linearly independent v1andv2or Span fvgforv¤0. In
the ﬁrst case, the subspace is a plane through the origin; in the second case, it is a line
through the origin. (See Figure 9.) It is helpful to keep these geometric pictures in mind,
even for an abstract vector space.

above. Thus His a subspace of R4by Theorem 1.
Example 11 illustrates a useful technique of expressing a subspace Has the set
of linear combinations of some small collection of vectors. If HDSpanfv1; : : : ; vpg,
we can think of the vectors v1; : : : ; vpin the spanning set as “handles” that allow us to
hold on to the subspace H. Calculations with the inﬁnitely many vectors in Hare often
reduced to operations with the ﬁnite number of vectors in the spanning set.

SOLUTION This question is Practice Problem 2 in Section 1.3, written here with
the term subspace rather than Span fv1;v2;v3g. The solution there shows that yis in
Spanfv1;v2;v3gif and only if hD5. That solution is worth reviewing now, along with
Exercises 11–16 and 19–21 in Section 1.3.
Although many vector spaces in this chapter will be subspaces of Rn, it is important
to keep in mind that the abstract theory applies to other vector spaces as well. Vector
spaces of functions arise in many applications, and they will receive more attention later.

4.2 NULL SPACES, COLUMN SPACES, AND LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
In applications of linear algebra, subspaces of Rnusually arise in one of two ways:
(1) as the set of all solutions to a system of homogeneous linear equations or (2) as the
set of all linear combinations of certain speciﬁed vectors. In this section, we compare
and contrast these two descriptions of subspaces, allowing us to practice using the
concept of a subspace. Actually, as you will soon discover, we have been working with

4.2 Null Spaces, Column Spaces, and Linear Transformations 201
subspaces ever since Section 1.3. The main new feature here is the terminology. The
section concludes with a discussion of the kernel and range of a linear transformation.
The Null Space of a Matrix
Consider the following system of homogeneous equations:
x1 3x2 2x3D0
 5x1C9x2Cx3D0(1)
In matrix form, this system is written as AxD0, where
AD1 3 2
 5 9 1
(2)
Recall that the set of all xthat satisfy (1) is called the solution set of the system (1).
Often it is convenient to relate this set directly to the matrix Aand the equation AxD0.
We call the set of xthat satisfy AxD0thenull space of the matrix A.
D E F I N I T I O N Thenull space of an mnmatrix A, written as Nul A, is the set of all solutions
of the homogeneous equation AxD0. In set notation,
NulAD fxWxis inRnandAxD0g
A more dynamic description of Nul Ais the set of all xinRnthat are mapped into
the zero vector of Rmvia the linear transformation x7!Ax. See Figure 1.

The term space innull space is appropriate because the null space of a matrix is a
vector space, as shown in the next theorem.
T H E O R E M 2 The null space of an mnmatrix Ais a subspace of Rn. Equivalently, the set of all
solutions to a system AxD0ofmhomogeneous linear equations in nunknowns
is a subspace of Rn.

202 CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
PROOF Certainly Nul Ais a subset of Rnbecause Ahasncolumns. We must show
that Nul Asatisﬁes the three properties of a subspace. Of course, 0is in Nul A. Next, let
uandvrepresent any two vectors in Nul A. Then
AuD0and AvD0
To show that uCvis in Nul A, we must show that A.uCv/D0. Using a property of
matrix multiplication, compute
A.uCv/DAuCAvD0C0D0
Thus uCvis in Nul A, and Nul Ais closed under vector addition. Finally, if cis any
scalar, then
A.cu/Dc.Au/Dc.0/D0
which shows that cuis in Nul A. Thus Nul Ais a subspace of Rn.
EXAMPLE 2 LetHbe the set of all vectors in R4whose coordinates a,b,c,d
satisfy the equations a 2bC5cDdandc aDb. Show that His a subspace of
R4.
SOLUTION Rearrange the equations that describe the elements of H, and note that H
is the set of all solutions of the following system of homogeneous linear equations:
a 2bC5c dD0
 a bCc D0
By Theorem 2, His a subspace of R4.
It is important that the linear equations deﬁning the set Hare homogeneous.
Otherwise, the set of solutions will deﬁnitely notbe a subspace (because the zero vector
is not a solution of a nonhomogeneous system). Also, in some cases, the set of solutions
could be empty.
An Explicit Description of NulA
There is no obvious relation between vectors in Nul Aand the entries in A. We say that
NulAis deﬁned implicitly , because it is deﬁned by a condition that must be checked.
No explicit list or description of the elements in Nul Ais given. However, solving
the equation AxD0amounts to producing an explicit description of Nul A. The next
example reviews the procedure from Section 1.5.

Every linear combination of u,v, and wis an element of Nul Aand vice versa. Thus
fu;v;wgis a spanning set for Nul A.
Two points should be made about the solution of Example 3 that apply to all
problems of this type where Nul Acontains nonzero vectors. We will use these facts
later.
1.The spanning set produced by the method in Example 3 is automatically linearly
independent because the free variables are the weights on the spanning vectors. For
instance, look at the 2nd, 4th, and 5th entries in the solution vector in (3) and note
thatx2uCx4vCx5wcan be 0only if the weights x2; x4, and x5are all zero.
2.When Nul Acontains nonzero vectors, the number of vectors in the spanning set for
NulAequals the number of free variables in the equation AxD0.
The Column Space of a Matrix
Another important subspace associated with a matrix is its column space. Unlike the
null space, the column space is deﬁned explicitly via linear combinations.
D E F I N I T I O N Thecolumn space of an mnmatrix A, written as Col A, is the set of all linear
combinations of the columns of A. IfADa1 an, then
ColADSpanfa1; : : : ; ang
Since Span fa1; : : : ; angis a subspace, by Theorem 1, the next theorem follows from
the deﬁnition of Col Aand the fact that the columns of Aare inRm.
T H E O R E M 3 The column space of an mnmatrix Ais a subspace of Rm.
Note that a typical vector in Col Acan be written as Axfor some xbecause the
notation Axstands for a linear combination of the columns of A. That is,
ColAD fbWbDAxfor some xinRng
The notation Axfor vectors in Col Aalso shows that Col Ais the range of the linear
transformation x7!Ax. We will return to this point of view at the end of the section.

Recall from Theorem 4 in Section 1.4 that the columns of AspanRmif and only if
the equation AxDbhas a solution for each b. We can restate this fact as follows:
The column space of an mnmatrix Ais all of Rmif and only if the equation
AxDbhas a solution for each binRm.
The Contrast Between NulAand ColA
It is natural to wonder how the null space and column space of a matrix are related.
In fact, the two spaces are quite dissimilar, as Examples 5–7 will show. Nevertheless,
a surprising connection between the null space and column space will emerge in
Section 4.6, after more theory is available.

a.If the column space of Ais a subspace of Rk, what is k?
b.If the null space of Ais a subspace of Rk, what is k?
SOLUTION
a.The columns of Aeach have three entries, so Col Ais a subspace of Rk, where kD3.
b.A vector xsuch that Axis deﬁned must have four entries, so Nul Ais a subspace of
Rk, where kD4.
When a matrix is not square, as in Example 5, the vectors in Nul Aand Col Alive
in entirely different “universes.” For example, no linear combination of vectors in R3
can produce a vector in R4. When Ais square, Nul Aand Col Ado have the zero vector
in common, and in special cases it is possible that some nonzero vectors belong to both
NulAand Col A.

In applications, a subspace usually arises as either the kernel or the range of an
appropriate linear transformation. For instance, the set of all solutions of a homoge-
neous linear differential equation turns out to be the kernel of a linear transformation.

4.2 Null Spaces, Column Spaces, and Linear Transformations 207
Typically, such a linear transformation is described in terms of one or more derivatives
of a function. To explain this in any detail would take us too far aﬁeld at this point. So
we consider only two examples. The ﬁrst explains why the operation of differentiation
is a linear transformation.
EXAMPLE 8 (Calculus required) LetVbe the vector space of all real-valued func-
tions fdeﬁned on an interval a; b with the property that they are differentiable and
their derivatives are continuous functions on a; b . LetWbe the vector space C a; b
of all continuous functions on a; b , and let DWV!Wbe the transformation that
changes finVinto its derivative f0. In calculus, two simple differentiation rules are
D.fCg/DD.f / CD.g/ and D.cf / DcD.f /
That is, Dis a linear transformation. It can be shown that the kernel of Dis the set of
constant functions on a; b and the range of Dis the set Wof all continuous functions
ona; b .
EXAMPLE 9 (Calculus required) The differential equation
y00C!2yD0 (4)
where !is a constant, is used to describe a variety of physical systems, such as the
vibration of a weighted spring, the movement of a pendulum, and the voltage in an
inductance-capacitance electrical circuit. The set of solutions of (4) is precisely the
kernel of the linear transformation that maps a function yDf .t/ into the function
f00.t/C!2f .t/ . Finding an explicit description of this vector space is a problem in
differential equations. The solution set turns out to be the space described in Exercise 19
in Section 4.1.

4.3 LINEARLY INDEPENDENT SETS; BASES
In this section we identify and study the subsets that span a vector space Vor a subspace
Has “efﬁciently” as possible. The key idea is that of linear independence, deﬁned as
inRn.
An indexed set of vectors fv1; : : : ; vpginVis said to be linearly independent if
the vector equation
c1v1Cc2v2C  C cpvpD0 (1)
hasonly the trivial solution, c1D0; : : : ; c pD0.1
The set fv1; : : : ; vpgis said to be linearly dependent if (1) has a nontrivial solution,
that is, if there are some weights, c1; : : : ; c p,not all zero , such that (1) holds. In such a
case, (1) is called a linear dependence relation among v1; : : : ; vp.
Just as in Rn, a set containing a single vector vis linearly independent if and only
ifv¤0. Also, a set of two vectors is linearly dependent if and only if one of the vectors
is a multiple of the other. And any set containing the zero vector is linearly dependent.
The following theorem has the same proof as Theorem 7 in Section 1.7.
T H E O R E M 4 An indexed set fv1; : : : ; vpgof two or more vectors, with v1¤0, is linearly
dependent if and only if some vj(with j > 1/ is a linear combination of the
preceding vectors, v1; : : : ; vj 1.
The main difference between linear dependence in Rnand in a general vector space
is that when the vectors are not n-tuples, the homogeneous equation (1) usually cannot
be written as a system of nlinear equations. That is, the vectors cannot be made into the
columns of a matrix Ain order to study the equation AxD0. We must rely instead on
the deﬁnition of linear dependence and on Theorem 4.
1It is convenient to use c1; : : : ; c pin (1) for the scalars instead of x1; : : : ; x p, as we did in Chapter 1.

4.3 Linearly Independent Sets; Bases 211
EXAMPLE 1 Letp1.t/D1,p2.t/Dt, and p3.t/D4 t. Then fp1;p2;p3gis
linearly dependent in Pbecause p3D4p1 p2.
EXAMPLE 2 The set fsint;costgis linearly independent in C 0; 1 , the space of
all continuous functions on 0t1, because sin tand cos tare not multiples of one
another as vectors in C 0; 1 . That is, there is no scalar csuch that cos tDcsintfor all
tin0; 1 . (Look at the graphs of sin tand cos t.) However, fsintcost;sin2tgis linearly
dependent because of the identity: sin 2tD2sintcost, for all t.
D E F I N I T I O N LetHbe a subspace of a vector space V. An indexed set of vectors
BD fb1; : : : ; bpginVis abasis forHif
(i)Bis a linearly independent set, and
(ii)the subspace spanned by Bcoincides with H; that is,
HDSpanfb1; : : : ; bpg
The deﬁnition of a basis applies to the case when HDV, because any vector space
is a subspace of itself. Thus a basis of Vis a linearly independent set that spans V.
Observe that when H¤V, condition (ii) includes the requirement that each of the
vectors b1; : : : ; bpmust belong to H, because Span fb1; : : : ; bpgcontains b1; : : : ; bp,
as shown in Section 4.1.
EXAMPLE 3 LetAbe an invertible nnmatrix—say, ADa1 an. Then

5. Determine if

SOLUTION Since there are exactly three vectors here in R3, we can use any of several
methods to determine if the matrix ADv1v2v3is invertible. For instance, two
row replacements reveal that Ahas three pivot positions. Thus Ais invertible. As in
Example 3, the columns of Aform a basis for R3.

This equality means that the polynomial on the left has the same values as the zero
polynomial on the right. A fundamental theorem in algebra says that the only polynomial

The Spanning Set Theorem
As we will see, a basis is an “efﬁcient” spanning set that contains no unnecessary vectors.
In fact, a basis can be constructed from a spanning set by discarding unneeded vectors.

Note that v3D5v1C3v2, and show that Span fv1;v2;v3g DSpanfv1;v2g. Then ﬁnd a
basis for the subspace H.
SOLUTION Every vector in Span fv1;v2gbelongs to Hbecause
H
v1v3
v2
c1v1Cc2v2Dc1v1Cc2v2C0v3
Now let xbe any vector in H—say, xDc1v1Cc2v2Cc3v3. Since v3D5v1C3v2, we
may substitute
xDc1v1Cc2v2Cc3.5v1C3v2/
D.c1C5c3/v1C.c2C3c3/v2
Thus xis in Span fv1;v2g, so every vector in Halready belongs to Span fv1;v2g. We
conclude that Hand Span fv1;v2gare actually the same set of vectors. It follows that
fv1;v2gis a basis of Hsincefv1;v2gis obviously linearly independent.
The next theorem generalizes Example 7.
T H E O R E M 5 The Spanning Set Theorem
LetSD fv1; : : : ; vpgbe a set in V, and let HDSpanfv1; : : : ; vpg.
a.If one of the vectors in S—say, vk—is a linear combination of the remaining
vectors in S, then the set formed from Sby removing vkstill spans H.
b.IfH¤ f0g, some subset of Sis a basis for H.
PROOF
a.By rearranging the list of vectors in S, if necessary, we may suppose that vpis a
linear combination of v1; : : : ; vp 1—say,
vpDa1v1C  C ap 1vp 1 (3)
Given any xinH, we may write
xDc1v1C  C cp 1vp 1Ccpvp (4)
for suitable scalars c1; : : : ; c p. Substituting the expression for vpfrom (3) into (4),
it is easy to see that xis a linear combination of v1; : : : ; vp 1. Thus fv1; : : : ; vp 1g
spans H, because xwas an arbitrary element of H.

4.3 Linearly Independent Sets; Bases 213
b.If the original spanning set Sis linearly independent, then it is already a basis for H.
Otherwise, one of the vectors in Sdepends on the others and can be deleted, by part
(a). So long as there are two or more vectors in the spanning set, we can repeat this
process until the spanning set is linearly independent and hence is a basis for H. If
the spanning set is eventually reduced to one vector, that vector will be nonzero (and
hence linearly independent) because H¤ f0g.
Bases for NulAand ColA
We already know how to ﬁnd vectors that span the null space of a matrix A. The
discussion in Section 4.2 pointed out that our method always produces a linearly
independent set when Nul Acontains nonzero vectors. So, in this case, that method
produces a basis for Nul A.
The next two examples describe a simple algorithm for ﬁnding a basis for the
column space.

Since b1¤0and no vector in Sis a linear combination of the vectors that precede it,
Sis linearly independent (Theorem 4). Thus Sis a basis for Col B.
What about a matrix Athat is notin reduced echelon form? Recall that any
linear dependence relationship among the columns of Acan be expressed in the form
AxD0, where xis a column of weights. (If some columns are not involved in a
particular dependence relation, then their weights are zero.) When Ais row reduced
to a matrix B, the columns of Bare often totally different from the columns of A.
However, the equations AxD0andBxD0have exactly the same set of solutions. If
ADa1 anandBDb1 bn, then the vector equations
x1a1C  C xnanD0and x1b1C  C xnbnD0
also have the same set of solutions. That is, the columns of Ahave exactly the same
linear dependence relationships as the columns of B.

is row equivalent to the matrix Bin Example 8. Find a basis for Col A.

214 CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
SOLUTION In Example 8 we saw that
b2D4b1and b4D2b1 b3
so we can expect that
a2D4a1and a4D2a1 a3
Check that this is indeed the case! Thus we may discard a2anda4when selecting
a minimal spanning set for Col A. In fact, fa1;a3;a5gmust be linearly independent
because any linear dependence relationship among a1,a3,a5would imply a linear
dependence relationship among b1,b3,b5. But we know that fb1;b3;b5gis a linearly
independent set. Thus fa1;a3;a5gis a basis for Col A. The columns we have used for
this basis are the pivot columns of A.
Examples 8 and 9 illustrate the following useful fact.
T H E O R E M 6 The pivot columns of a matrix Aform a basis for Col A.
PROOF The general proof uses the arguments discussed above. Let Bbe the reduced
echelon form of A. The set of pivot columns of Bis linearly independent, for no
vector in the set is a linear combination of the vectors that precede it. Since Ais row
equivalent to B, the pivot columns of Aare linearly independent as well, because any
linear dependence relation among the columns of Acorresponds to a linear dependence
relation among the columns of B. For this same reason, every nonpivot column of Ais
a linear combination of the pivot columns of A. Thus the nonpivot columns of Amay
be discarded from the spanning set for Col A, by the Spanning Set Theorem. This leaves
the pivot columns of Aas a basis for Col A.
Warning: The pivot columns of a matrix Aare evident when Ahas been reduced only
toechelon form. But, be careful to use the pivot columns of Aitself for the basis of
ColA. Row operations can change the column space of a matrix. The columns of an
echelon form BofAare often not in the column space of A. For instance, the columns
of matrix Bin Example 8 all have zeros in their last entries, so they cannot span the
column space of matrix Ain Example 9.
Two Views of a Basis
When the Spanning Set Theorem is used, the deletion of vectors from a spanning set
must stop when the set becomes linearly independent. If an additional vector is deleted,
it will not be a linear combination of the remaining vectors, and hence the smaller set
will no longer span V. Thus a basis is a spanning set that is as small as possible.
A basis is also a linearly independent set that is as large as possible. If Sis a basis
forV, and if Sis enlarged by one vector—say, w—from V, then the new set cannot be
linearly independent, because Sspans V, and wis therefore a linear combination of the
elements in S.
EXAMPLE 10 The following three sets in R3show how a linearly independent set
can be enlarged to a basis and how further enlargement destroys the linear independence
of the set. Also, a spanning set can be shrunk to a basis, but further shrinking destroys

4.4 COORDINATE SYSTEMS
An important reason for specifying a basis Bfor a vector space Vis to impose a
“coordinate system” on V. This section will show that if Bcontains nvectors, then
the coordinate system will make Vact like Rn. IfVis already Rnitself, then Bwill
determine a coordinate system that gives a new “view” of V.
The existence of coordinate systems rests on the following fundamental result.
T H E O R E M 7 The Unique Representation Theorem
LetBD fb1; : : : ; bngbe a basis for a vector space V. Then for each xinV, there
exists a unique set of scalars c1; : : : ; c nsuch that
xDc1b1C  C cnbn (1)
PROOF Since Bspans V, there exist scalars such that (1) holds. Suppose xalso has the
representation
xDd1b1C  C dnbn
for scalars d1; : : : ; d n. Then, subtracting, we have
0Dx xD.c1 d1/b1C  C .cn dn/bn (2)
Since Bis linearly independent, the weights in (2) must all be zero. That is, cjDdjfor

A Graphical Interpretation of Coordinates
A coordinate system on a set consists of a one-to-one mapping of the points in the set
intoRn. For example, ordinary graph paper provides a coordinate system for the plane
when one selects perpendicular axes and a unit of measurement on each axis. Figure 1
shows the standard basis fe1;e2g, the vectors b1.De1/andb2from Example 1, and the
vector xD1
6
. The coordinates 1 and 6 give the location of xrelative to the standard
basis: 1 unit in the e1direction and 6 units in the e2direction.
Figure 2 shows the vectors b1,b2, and xfrom Figure 1. (Geometrically, the three
vectors lie on a vertical line in both ﬁgures.) However, the standard coordinate grid
was erased and replaced by a grid especially adapted to the basis Bin Example 1. The
coordinate vector xBD 2

gives the location of xon this new coordinate system:
 2units in the b1direction and 3 units in the b2direction.

xDc1b1Cc2b2C  C cnbn
is equivalent to
xDPBxB(4)
We call PBthechange-of-coordinates matrix from Bto the standard basis in Rn.
Left-multiplication by PBtransforms the coordinate vector xBintox. The change-of-
coordinates equation (4) is important and will be needed at several points in Chapters 5
and 7.
Since the columns of PBform a basis for Rn,PBis invertible (by the Invertible
Matrix Theorem). Left-multiplication by P 1
Bconverts xinto its B-coordinate vector:
P 1
BxDxB
The correspondence x7!xB, produced here by P 1
B, is the coordinate mapping
mentioned earlier. Since P 1
Bis an invertible matrix, the coordinate mapping is a one-
to-one linear transformation from RnontoRn, by the Invertible Matrix Theorem. (See
also Theorem 12 in Section 1.9.) This property of the coordinate mapping is also true
in a general vector space that has a basis, as we shall see.
The Coordinate Mapping
Choosing a basis BD fb1; : : : ; bngfor a vector space Vintroduces a coordinate system
inV. The coordinate mapping x7!xBconnects the possibly unfamiliar space Vto
the familiar space Rn. See Figure 5. Points in Vcan now be identiﬁed by their new
“names.”

T H E O R E M 8 LetBD fb1; : : : ; bngbe a basis for a vector space V. Then the coordinate mapping

PROOF Take two typical vectors in V, say,

Thus the coordinate mapping also preserves scalar multiplication and hence is a linear
transformation. See Exercises 23 and 24 for veriﬁcation that the coordinate mapping is
one-to-one and maps VontoRn.
The linearity of the coordinate mapping extends to linear combinations, just as in
Section 1.8. If u1; : : : ; upare in Vand if c1; : : : ; c pare scalars, then
c1u1C  C cpupBDc1u1BC  C cpupB(5)
In words, (5) says that the B-coordinate vector of a linear combination of u1; : : : ; upis
thesame linear combination of their coordinate vectors.
The coordinate mapping in Theorem 8 is an important example of an isomorphism
from VontoRn. In general, a one-to-one linear transformation from a vector space V
onto a vector space Wis called an isomorphism from VontoW(isofrom the Greek
for “the same,” and morph from the Greek for “form” or “structure”). The notation and
terminology for VandWmay differ, but the two spaces are indistinguishable as vector
spaces. Every vector space calculation in Vis accurately reproduced in W, and vice
versa . In particular, any real vector space with a basis of nvectors is indistinguishable
fromRn. See Exercises 25 and 26.

EXAMPLE 5 LetBbe the standard basis of the space P3of polynomials; that is, let
BD f1; t; t2; t3g. A typical element pofP3has the form
p.t/Da0Ca1tCa2t2Ca3t3

Thus the coordinate mapping p7!pBis an isomorphism from P3ontoR4. All vector
space operations in P3correspond to operations in R4.
If we think of P3andR4as displays on two computer screens that are connected
via the coordinate mapping, then every vector space operation in P3on one screen is
exactly duplicated by a corresponding vector operation in R4on the other screen. The
vectors on the P3screen look different from those on the R4screen, but they “act” as
vectors in exactly the same way. See Figure 6.

FIGURE 6 The space P3is isomorphic to R4.
EXAMPLE 6 Use coordinate vectors to verify that the polynomials 1C2t2,
4CtC5t2, and 3C2tare linearly dependent in P2.
SOLUTION The coordinate mapping from Example 5 produces the coordinate vectors
.1; 0; 2/ ,.4; 1; 5/ , and .3; 2; 0/ , respectively. Writing these vectors as the columns of a
matrix A, we can determine their independence by row reducing the augmented matrix

The columns of Aare linearly dependent, so the corresponding polynomials are linearly
dependent. In fact, it is easy to check that column 3 of Ais 2 times column 2 minus 5
times column 1. The corresponding relation for the polynomials is
3C2tD2.4CtC5t2/ 5.1C2t2/
The ﬁnal example concerns a plane in R3that is isomorphic to R2.

4.5 THE DIMENSION OF A VECTOR SPACE
Theorem 8 in Section 4.4 implies that a vector space Vwith a basis Bcontaining
nvectors is isomorphic to Rn. This section shows that this number nis an intrinsic
property (called the dimension) of the space Vthat does not depend on the particular
choice of basis. The discussion of dimension will give additional insight into properties
of bases.
The ﬁrst theorem generalizes a well-known result about the vector space Rn.
T H E O R E M 9 If a vector space Vhas a basis BD fb1; : : : ; bng, then any set in Vcontaining
more than nvectors must be linearly dependent.
PROOF Letfu1; : : : ; upgbe a set in Vwith more than nvectors. The coordinate vectors
u1B; : : : ;  upBform a linearly dependent set in Rn, because there are more vectors
(p) than entries ( n) in each vector. So there exist scalars c1; : : : ; c p, not all zero, such
that

The zero vector on the right displays the nweights needed to build the vector

0b1C  C 0bnD0. Since the ciare not all zero, fu1; : : : ; upgis linearly
dependent.1
Theorem 9 implies that if a vector space Vhas a basis BD fb1; : : : ; bng, then each
linearly independent set in Vhas no more than nvectors.
1Theorem 9 also applies to inﬁnite sets in V. An inﬁnite set is said to be linearly dependent if some ﬁnite
subset is linearly dependent; otherwise, the set is linearly independent. If Sis an inﬁnite set in V, take any
subsetfu1; : : : ; upgofS, with p > n . The proof above shows that this subset is linearly dependent, and
hence so is S.

228 CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
T H E O R E M 1 0 If a vector space Vhas a basis of nvectors, then every basis of Vmust consist of
exactly nvectors.
PROOF LetB1be a basis of nvectors and B2be any other basis (of V). Since B1is
a basis and B2is linearly independent, B2has no more than nvectors, by Theorem 9.
Also, since B2is a basis and B1is linearly independent, B2has at least nvectors. Thus
B2consists of exactly nvectors.
If a nonzero vector space Vis spanned by a ﬁnite set S, then a subset of Sis a
basis for V, by the Spanning Set Theorem. In this case, Theorem 10 ensures that the
following deﬁnition makes sense.
D E F I N I T I O N IfVis spanned by a ﬁnite set, then Vis said to be ﬁnite-dimensional , and the
dimension ofV, written as dim V, is the number of vectors in a basis for V. The
dimension of the zero vector space f0gis deﬁned to be zero. If Vis not spanned
by a ﬁnite set, then Vis said to be inﬁnite-dimensional .
EXAMPLE 1 The standard basis for Rncontains nvectors, so dim RnDn. The
standard polynomial basis f1; t; t2gshows that dim P2D3. In general, dim PnDnC1.
The space Pof all polynomials is inﬁnite-dimensional (Exercise 27).

Clearly, v1¤0,v2is not a multiple of v1, but v3is a multiple of v2. By the Spanning

linear combination of v1andv2. Sofv1;v2;v4gis linearly independent (by Theorem 4
in Section 4.3) and hence is a basis for H. Thus dim HD3.

Subspaces of a Finite-Dimensional Space
The next theorem is a natural counterpart to the Spanning Set Theorem.
T H E O R E M 1 1 LetHbe a subspace of a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space V. Any linearly
independent set in Hcan be expanded, if necessary, to a basis for H. Also, His
ﬁnite-dimensional and
dimHdimV
PROOF IfHD f0g, then certainly dim HD0dimV. Otherwise, let SD fu1; : : : ;
ukgbe any linearly independent set in H. IfSspans H, then Sis a basis for H.
Otherwise, there is some ukC1inHthat is not in Span S. But then fu1; : : : ; uk;ukC1g
will be linearly independent, because no vector in the set can be a linear combination of
vectors that precede it (by Theorem 4).
So long as the new set does not span H, we can continue this process of expanding
Sto a larger linearly independent set in H. But the number of vectors in a linearly
independent expansion of Scan never exceed the dimension of V, by Theorem 9.
So eventually the expansion of Swill span Hand hence will be a basis for H, and
dimHdimV.
When the dimension of a vector space or subspace is known, the search for a basis
is simpliﬁed by the next theorem. It says that if a set has the right number of elements,
then one has only to show either that the set is linearly independent or that it spans the
space. The theorem is of critical importance in numerous applied problems (involving
differential equations or difference equations, for example) where linear independence
is much easier to verify than spanning.
T H E O R E M 1 2 The Basis Theorem
LetVbe ap-dimensional vector space, p1. Any linearly independent set of
exactly pelements in Vis automatically a basis for V. Any set of exactly p
elements that spans Vis automatically a basis for V.
SECOND REVISED PAGES

230 CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
PROOF By Theorem 11, a linearly independent set Sofpelements can be extended to
a basis for V. But that basis must contain exactly pelements, since dim VDp. SoS
must already be a basis for V. Now suppose that Shaspelements and spans V. Since
Vis nonzero, the Spanning Set Theorem implies that a subset S0ofSis a basis of V.
Since dim VDp,S0must contain pvectors. Hence SDS0.
The Dimensions of NulAand ColA
Since the pivot columns of a matrix Aform a basis for Col A, we know the dimension
of Col Aas soon as we know the pivot columns. The dimension of Nul Amight seem to
require more work, since ﬁnding a basis for Nul Ausually takes more time than a basis
for Col A. But there is a shortcut!
LetAbe an mnmatrix, and suppose the equation AxD0haskfree variables.
From Section 4.2, we know that the standard method of ﬁnding a spanning set for Nul A
will produce exactly klinearly independent vectors—say, u1; : : : ; uk—one for each
free variable. So fu1; : : : ; ukgis a basis for Nul A, and the number of free variables
determines the size of the basis. Let us summarize these facts for future reference.
The dimension of Nul Ais the number of free variables in the equation AxD0,
and the dimension of Col Ais the number of pivot columns in A.

4.6 RANK
With the aid of vector space concepts, this section takes a look inside a matrix and
reveals several interesting and useful relationships hidden in its rows and columns.
For instance, imagine placing 2000 random numbers into a 4050matrix Aand
then determining both the maximum number of linearly independent columns in Aand
the maximum number of linearly independent columns in AT(rows in A). Remarkably,
SECOND REVISED PAGES

4.6 Rank 233
the two numbers are the same. As we’ll soon see, their common value is the rank of the
matrix. To explain why, we need to examine the subspace spanned by the rows of A.
The Row Space
IfAis an mnmatrix, each row of Ahasnentries and thus can be identiﬁed with
a vector in Rn. The set of all linear combinations of the row vectors is called the row
space ofAand is denoted by Row A. Each row has nentries, so Row Ais a subspace
ofRn. Since the rows of Aare identiﬁed with the columns of AT, we could also write
ColATin place of Row A.

If we knew some linear dependence relations among the rows of matrix Ain
Example 1, we could use the Spanning Set Theorem to shrink the spanning set to a
basis. Unfortunately, row operations on Awill not give us that information, because
row operations change the row-dependence relations. But row reducing Ais certainly

IfBis in echelon form, the nonzero rows of Bform a basis for the row space of
Aas well as for that of B.
PROOF IfBis obtained from Aby row operations, the rows of Bare linear com-
binations of the rows of A. It follows that any linear combination of the rows of B
is automatically a linear combination of the rows of A. Thus the row space of Bis
contained in the row space of A. Since row operations are reversible, the same argument
shows that the row space of Ais a subset of the row space of B. So the two row spaces
are the same. If Bis in echelon form, its nonzero rows are linearly independent because
no nonzero row is a linear combination of the nonzero rows below it. (Apply Theorem
4 to the nonzero rows of Bin reverse order, with the ﬁrst row last.) Thus the nonzero
rows of Bform a basis of the (common) row space of BandA.
The main result of this section involves the three spaces: Row A, ColA, and Nul A.
The following example prepares the way for this result and shows how onesequence of
row operations on Aleads to bases for all three spaces.

reduce until the pivot columns of ATare found. These pivot columns of ATare rows of A, and they form
a basis for the row space of A.

Warning: Although the ﬁrst three rows of Bin Example 2 are linearly independent,
it is wrong to conclude that the ﬁrst three rows of Aare linearly independent. (In fact,
the third row of Ais 2 times the ﬁrst row plus 7 times the second row.) Row operations
may change the linear dependence relations among the rows of a matrix.
The Rank Theorem
The next theorem describes fundamental relations among the dimensions of Col A,
WEB
RowA, and Nul A.
D E F I N I T I O N Therank ofAis the dimension of the column space of A.
Since Row Ais the same as Col AT, the dimension of the row space of Ais the rank
ofAT. The dimension of the null space is sometimes called the nullity ofA, though we
will not use this term.
An alert reader may have already discovered part or all of the next theorem while
working the exercises in Section 4.5 or reading Example 2 above.
T H E O R E M 1 4 The Rank Theorem
The dimensions of the column space and the row space of an mnmatrix Aare
equal. This common dimension, the rank of A, also equals the number of pivot
positions in Aand satisﬁes the equation
rankACdim Nul ADn
PROOF By Theorem 6 in Section 4.3, rank Ais the number of pivot columns in A.
Equivalently, rank Ais the number of pivot positions in an echelon form BofA.
Furthermore, since Bhas a nonzero row for each pivot, and since these rows form a
basis for the row space of A, the rank of Ais also the dimension of the row space.
From Section 4.5, the dimension of Nul Aequals the number of free variables in
the equation AxD0. Expressed another way, the dimension of Nul Ais the number of
columns of Athat are notpivot columns. (It is the number of these columns, not the
columns themselves, that is related to Nul A.) Obviously,
number of
pivot columns
Cnumber of
nonpivot columns
Dnumber of
columns
This proves the theorem.
The ideas behind Theorem 14 are visible in the calculations in Example 2. The
three pivot positions in the echelon form Bdetermine the basic variables and identify
the basis vectors for Col Aand those for Row A.
EXAMPLE 3
a.IfAis a79matrix with a two-dimensional null space, what is the rank of A?
b.Could a 69matrix have a two-dimensional null space?
SECOND REVISED PAGES


--- Page 253 ---
236 CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
SOLUTION
a.Since Ahas 9 columns, .rankA/C2D9, and hence rank AD7.
b.No. If a 69matrix, call it B, had a two-dimensional null space, it would have to
have rank 7, by the Rank Theorem. But the columns of Bare vectors in R6, and so
the dimension of Col Bcannot exceed 6; that is, rank Bcannot exceed 6.
The next example provides a nice way to visualize the subspaces we have been
studying. In Chapter 6, we will learn that Row Aand Nul Ahave only the zero vector
in common and are actually “perpendicular” to each other. The same fact will apply to
RowAT.DColA/and Nul AT. So Figure 1, which accompanies Example 4, creates
a good mental image for the general case. (The value of studying ATalong with Ais

Applications to Systems of Equations
The Rank Theorem is a powerful tool for processing information about systems of
linear equations. The next example simulates the way a real-life problem using linear
equations might be stated, without explicit mention of linear algebra terms such as
matrix, subspace, and dimension.
EXAMPLE 5 A scientist has found two solutions to a homogeneous system of
40 equations in 42 variables. The two solutions are not multiples, and all other solutions
can be constructed by adding together appropriate multiples of these two solutions.
Can the scientist be certain that an associated nonhomogeneous system (with the same
coefﬁcients) has a solution?
SOLUTION Yes. Let Abe the 4042coefﬁcient matrix of the system. The given
information implies that the two solutions are linearly independent and span Nul A.
So dim Nul AD2. By the Rank Theorem, dim Col AD42 2D40. Since R40is the
only subspace of R40whose dimension is 40, Col Amust be all of R40. This means that
every nonhomogeneous equation AxDbhas a solution.

4.6 Rank 237
Rank and the Invertible Matrix Theorem
The various vector space concepts associated with a matrix provide several more
statements for the Invertible Matrix Theorem. The new statements listed here follow
those in the original Invertible Matrix Theorem in Section 2.3.
T H E O R E M The Invertible Matrix Theorem (continued)
LetAbe an nnmatrix. Then the following statements are each equivalent to
the statement that Ais an invertible matrix.
m.The columns of Aform a basis of Rn.
n.ColADRn
o.dim Col ADn
p.rankADn
q.NulAD f0g
r.dim Nul AD0
PROOF Statement (m) is logically equivalent to statements (e) and (h) regarding linear
independence and spanning. The other ﬁve statements are linked to the earlier ones of
the theorem by the following chain of almost trivial implications:
.g/).n/).o/).p/).r/).q/).d/
Statement (g), which says that the equation AxDbhas at least one solution for each bin
Rn, implies (n), because Col Ais precisely the set of all bsuch that the equation AxDb
is consistent. The implications (n) )(o))(p) follow from the deﬁnitions of dimension
and rank. If the rank of Aisn, the number of columns of A, then dim Nul AD0, by the
Rank Theorem, and so Nul AD f0g. Thus (p) )(r))(q). Also, (q) implies that the
equation AxD0has only the trivial solution, which is statement (d). Since statements
(d) and (g) are already known to be equivalent to the statement that Ais invertible, the
proof is complete.
SGExpanded Table for the
IMT 4–19
We have refrained from adding to the Invertible Matrix Theorem obvious state-
ments about the row space of A, because the row space is the column space of AT.
Recall from statement (l) of the Invertible Matrix Theorem that Ais invertible if and
only if ATis invertible. Hence every statement in the Invertible Matrix Theorem can
also be stated for AT. To do so would double the length of the theorem and produce a
list of more than 30 statements!

N U M E R I C A L N O T E
Many algorithms discussed in this text are useful for understanding concepts
and making simple computations by hand. However, the algorithms are often
unsuitable for large-scale problems in real life.
Rank determination is a good example. It would seem easy to reduce a matrix
to echelon form and count the pivots. But unless exact arithmetic is performed
on a matrix whose entries are speciﬁed exactly, row operations can change the
apparent rank of a matrix. For instance, if the value of xin the matrix5 7
5 x
is not stored exactly as 7 in a computer, then the rank may be 1 or 2, depending
on whether the computer treats x 7as zero.
In practical applications, the effective rank of a matrix Ais often determined
from the singular value decomposition of A, to be discussed in Section 7.4. This
decomposition is also a reliable source of bases for Col A, Row A, Nul A, and
NulAT.

When a basis Bis chosen for an n-dimensional vector space V, the associated coordinate
mapping onto Rnprovides a coordinate system for V. Each xinVis identiﬁed uniquely
by its B-coordinate vector xB.1
In some applications, a problem is described initially using a basis B, but the
problem’s solution is aided by changing Bto a new basis C. (Examples will be given in

The matrix PC Bin Theorem 15 is called the change-of-coordinates matrix from

The columns of PC Bare linearly independent because they are the coordinate
vectors of the linearly independent set B. (See Exercise 25 in Section 4.4.) Since PC B
is square, it must be invertible, by the Invertible Matrix Theorem. Left-multiplying both

4.8 APPLICATIONS TO DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS
Now that powerful computers are widely available, more and more scientiﬁc and
engineering problems are being treated in a way that uses discrete, or digital, data rather
than continuous data. Difference equations are often the appropriate tool to analyze
such data. Even when a differential equation is used to model a continuous process, a
numerical solution is often produced from a related difference equation.
This section highlights some fundamental properties of linear difference equations
that are best explained using linear algebra.
Discrete-Time Signals
The vector space Sof discrete-time signals was introduced in Section 4.1. A signal in
Sis a function deﬁned only on the integers and is visualized as a sequence of numbers,
say,fykg. Figure 1 shows three typical signals whose general terms are .:7/k,1k, and
. 1/k, respectively.
yk = .7k
–2–1012 –2–1012 –202yk = 1kyk = (–1)k
FIGURE 1 Three signals in S.
SECOND REVISED PAGES


--- Page 264 ---
4.8 Applications to Difference Equations 247
Digital signals obviously arise in electrical and control systems engineering, but
discrete-data sequences are also generated in biology, physics, economics, demography,
and many other areas, wherever a process is measured, or sampled , at discrete time
intervals. When a process begins at a speciﬁc time, it is sometimes convenient to write
a signal as a sequence of the form .y0; y1; y2; : : :/ . The terms ykfork < 0 either are
assumed to be zero or are simply omitted.
EXAMPLE 1 The crystal-clear sounds from a compact disc player are produced
from music that has been sampled at the rate of 44,100 times per second. See Figure 2.
At each measurement, the amplitude of the music signal is recorded as a number, say,
yk. The original music is composed of many different sounds of varying frequencies,
yet the sequence fykgcontains enough information to reproduce all the frequencies
in the sound up to about 20,000 cycles per second, higher than the human ear can
sense.

FIGURE 2 Sampled data from a music signal.
Linear Independence in the Space Sof Signals
To simplify notation, we consider a set of only three signals in S, say,fukg,fvkg, and
fwkg. They are linearly independent precisely when the equation
c1ukCc2vkCc3wkD0for all k (1)
implies that c1Dc2Dc3D0. The phrase “for all k” means for all integers—positive,
negative, and zero. One could also consider signals that start with kD0, for example,
in which case, “for all k” would mean for all integers k0.
Suppose c1,c2,c3satisfy (1). Then equation (1) holds for any three consecutive
values of k, say, k,kC1, and kC2. Thus (1) implies that
c1ukC1Cc2vkC1Cc3wkC1D0for all k
and
c1ukC2Cc2vkC2Cc3wkC2D0for all k
Hence c1,c2,c3satisfy

The coefﬁcient matrix in this system is called the Casorati matrix of the signals, and
SG The Casorati Test 4–30
the determinant of the matrix is called the Casoratian offukg,fvkg, andfwkg. If
the Casorati matrix is invertible for at least one value of k, then (2) will imply that
c1Dc2Dc3D0, which will prove that the three signals are linearly independent.

Row operations can show fairly easily that this matrix is always invertible. However, it
is faster to substitute a value for k—say, kD0—and row reduce the numerical matrix:

The Casorati matrix is invertible for kD0. So 1k,. 2/k, and 3kare linearly
independent.
If a Casorati matrix is not invertible, the associated signals being tested may or
may not be linearly dependent. (See Exercise 33.) However, it can be shown that if
the signals are all solutions of the same homogeneous difference equation (described
below), then either the Casorati matrix is invertible for all kand the signals are linearly
independent, or else the Casorati matrix is not invertible for all kand the signals are
linearly dependent. A nice proof using linear transformations is in the Study Guide .
Linear Difference Equations
Given scalars a0; : : : ; a n, with a0andannonzero, and given a signal f´kg, the equation
a0ykCnCa1ykCn 1C  C an 1ykC1CanykD´kfor all k (3)
is called a linear difference equation (orlinear recurrence relation )of order n. For
simplicity, a0is often taken equal to 1. If f´kgis the zero sequence, the equation is
homogeneous ; otherwise, the equation is nonhomogeneous .
EXAMPLE 3 In digital signal processing, a difference equation such as (3) de-
scribes a linear ﬁlter , and a0; : : : ; a nare called the ﬁlter coefﬁcients . Iffykgis treated
as the input and f´kgas the output, then the solutions of the associated homogeneous
equation are the signals that are ﬁltered outand transformed into the zero signal. Let us
feed two different signals into the ﬁlter
:35y kC2C:5ykC1C:35y kD´k
Here .35 is an abbreviation forp
2=4. The ﬁrst signal is created by sampling the
continuous signal yDcos.t=4/ at integer values of t, as in Figure 3(a). The discrete
signal is
fykg D f : : : ;cos.0/;cos.=4/; cos.2=4/; cos.3=4/; : : : g
For simplicity, write :7in place of p
2=2, so that
fykg D f : : : ; 1; :7; 0;  :7; 1; :7; 0; :7; 1; :7; 0; : : : g-kD0
Table 1 shows a calculation of the output sequence f´kg, where :35.:7/ is an abbreviation
for.p
2=4/.p
2=2/D:25. The output is fykg, shifted by one term.

A different input signal is produced from the higher frequency signal
yDcos.3t=4/ , shown in Figure 3(b). Sampling at the same rate as before produces a
new input sequence:
fwkg D f : : : ; 1;  :7; 0; :7;  1; :7; 0;  :7; 1;  :7; 0; : : : g-kD0
When fwkgis fed into the ﬁlter, the output is the zero sequence. The ﬁlter, called a
low-pass ﬁlter , letsfykgpass through, but stops the higher frequency fwkg.
In many applications, a sequence f´kgis speciﬁed for the right side of a difference
equation (3), and a fykgthat satisﬁes (3) is called a solution of the equation. The next
example shows how to ﬁnd solutions for a homogeneous equation.

ykDrkfor some r. Find some solutions of the equation

In general, a nonzero signal rksatisﬁes the homogeneous difference equation

if and only if ris a root of the auxiliary equation
rnCa1rn 1C  C an 1rCanD0
We will not consider the case in which ris a repeated root of the auxiliary equation.
When the auxiliary equation has a complex root , the difference equation has solutions
of the form skcosk!andsksink!, for constants sand!. This happened in Example 3.

It is readily checked that Tis alinear transformation. This implies that the solution set
of the homogeneous equation
ykCnCa1ykCn 1C  C an 1ykC1CanykD0for all k
is the kernel of T(the set of signals that Tmaps into the zero signal), and hence the
solution set is a subspace ofS. Any linear combination of solutions is again a solution.
The next theorem, a simple but basic result, will lead to more information about the
solution sets of difference equations.
T H E O R E M 1 6 Ifan¤0and iff´kgis given, the equation
ykCnCa1ykCn 1C  C an 1ykC1CanykD´kfor all k (7)
has a unique solution whenever y0; : : : ; y n 1are speciﬁed.
PROOF Ify0; : : : ; y n 1are speciﬁed, use (7) to deﬁne
ynD´0 a1yn 1C  C an 1y1Cany0
And now that y1; : : : ; y nare speciﬁed, use (7) to deﬁne ynC1. In general, use the
recurrence relation
ynCkD´k a1ykCn 1C  C anyk (8)

ykD1
an´k 1
anykCnCa1ykCn 1C  C an 1ykC1 (9)
This produces a signal that satisﬁes (7). Conversely, any signal that satisﬁes (7) for all
kcertainly satisﬁes (8) and (9), so the solution of (7) is unique.

PROOF As was pointed out earlier, His a subspace of Sbecause His the kernel
of a linear transformation. For fykginH, letFfykgbe the vector in Rngiven by
.y0; y1; : : : ; y n 1/. It is readily veriﬁed that FWH!Rnis a linear transformation.
Given any vector .y0; y1; : : : ; y n 1/inRn, Theorem 16 says that there is a unique
signal fykginHsuch that Ffykg D.y0; y1; : : : ; y n 1/. This means that Fis a one-
to-one linear transformation of HontoRn; that is, Fis an isomorphism. Thus

EXAMPLE 5 Find a basis for the set of all solutions to the difference equation
ykC3 2ykC2 5ykC1C6ykD0for all k
SOLUTION Our work in linear algebra really pays off now! We know from Examples 2
and 4 that 1k,. 2/k, and 3kare linearly independent solutions. In general, it can be
difﬁcult to verify directly that a set of signals spans the solution space. But that is no
problem here because of two key theorems—Theorem 17, which shows that the solution
space is exactly three-dimensional, and the Basis Theorem in Section 4.5, which says
that a linearly independent set of nvectors in an n-dimensional space is automatically
a basis. So 1k,. 2/k, and 3kform a basis for the solution space.
The standard way to describe the “general solution” of the difference equation (10)
is to exhibit a basis for the subspace of all solutions. Such a basis is usually called a
fundamental set of solutions of (10). In practice, if you can ﬁnd nlinearly independent
signals that satisfy (10), they will automatically span the n-dimensional solution space,
as explained in Example 5.
Nonhomogeneous Equations
The general solution of the nonhomogeneous difference equation
ykCnCa1ykCn 1C  C an 1ykC1CanykD´kfor all k (11)
can be written as one particular solution of (11) plus an arbitrary linear combination of
a fundamental set of solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation (10). This
fact is analogous to the result in Section 1.5 showing that the solution sets of AxDb
andAxD0are parallel. Both results have the same explanation: The mapping x7!Ax
is linear, and the mapping that transforms the signal fykginto the signal f´kgin (11) is
linear. See Exercise 35.
EXAMPLE 6 Verify that the signal ykDk2satisﬁes the difference equation

Then ﬁnd a description of all solutions of this equation.

252 CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
The roots are rD1; 3. So two solutions of the homogeneous difference equation are 1k
and3k. They are obviously not multiples of each other, so they are linearly independent
signals. By Theorem 17, the solution space is two-dimensional, so 3kand1kform a basis
for the set of solutions of equation (13). Translating that set by a particular solution of
the nonhomogeneous equation (12), we obtain the general solution of (12):

Solution sets of difference

A modern way to study a homogeneous nth-order linear difference equation is to replace
it by an equivalent system of ﬁrst-order difference equations, written in the form
xkC1DAxkfor all k
where the vectors xkare inRnandAis annnmatrix.
A simple example of such a (vector-valued) difference equation was already studied
in Section 1.10. Further examples will be covered in Sections 4.9 and 5.6.

21. When a signal is produced from a sequence of measurements
made on a process (a chemical reaction, a ﬂow of heat
through a tube, a moving robot arm, etc.), the signal usually
contains random noise produced by measurement errors. A
standard method of preprocessing the data to reduce the noise
is to smooth or ﬁlter the data. One simple ﬁlter is a moving
average that replaces each ykby its average with the two

4.9 APPLICATIONS TO MARKOV CHAINS
The Markov chains described in this section are used as mathematical models of a
wide variety of situations in biology, business, chemistry, engineering, physics, and
elsewhere. In each case, the model is used to describe an experiment or measurement
that is performed many times in the same way, where the outcome of each trial of the
experiment will be one of several speciﬁed possible outcomes, and where the outcome
of one trial depends only on the immediately preceding trial.
For example, if the population of a city and its suburbs were measured each year,
then a vector such as
x0D:60
:40
(1)
SECOND REVISED PAGES


--- Page 273 ---
256 CHAPTER 4 Vector Spaces
could indicate that 60% of the population lives in the city and 40% in the suburbs. The
decimals in x0add up to 1 because they account for the entire population of the region.
Percentages are more convenient for our purposes here than population totals.
A vector with nonnegative entries that add up to 1 is called a probability vector . A
stochastic matrix is a square matrix whose columns are probability vectors. A Markov
chain is a sequence of probability vectors x0;x1;x2; : : :, together with a stochastic
matrix P, such that
x1DPx0;x2DPx1;x3DPx2; : : :
Thus the Markov chain is described by the ﬁrst-order difference equation
xkC1DPxkforkD0; 1; 2; : : :
When a Markov chain of vectors in Rndescribes a system or a sequence of
experiments, the entries in xklist, respectively, the probabilities that the system is in
each of npossible states, or the probabilities that the outcome of the experiment is one
ofnpossible outcomes. For this reason, xkis often called a state vector .
EXAMPLE 1 Section 1.10 examined a model for population movement between a
city and its suburbs. See Figure 1. The annual migration between these two parts of the
metropolitan region was governed by the migration matrix M:

That is, each year 5% of the city population moves to the suburbs, and 3% of the
suburban population moves to the city. The columns of Mare probability vectors, so

city and 400,000 in the suburbs. Then the initial distribution of the population in the
region is given by x0in (1) above. What is the distribution of the population in 2015?

voting precinct are represented by a vector xinR3:

% voting Republican (R)
% voting Libertarian (L)3

Suppose we record the outcome of the congressional election every two years by a vector
of this type and the outcome of one election depends only on the results of the preceding
election. Then the sequence of vectors that describe the votes every two years may be a
Markov chain. As an example of a stochastic matrix Pfor this chain, we take

in one election will do in the next election. Here we have supposed that 70% will vote D
again in the next election, 20% will vote R, and 10% will vote L. Similar interpretations
hold for the other columns of P. A diagram for this matrix is shown in Figure 2.

538.7% will vote D.

13.5% will vote L.
To understand why x1does indeed give the outcome of the next election, suppose 1000
persons voted in the “ﬁrst” election, with 550 voting D, 400 voting R, and 50 voting L.
(See the percentages in x0.) In the next election, 70% of the 550 will vote D again, 10%
of the 400 will switch from R to D, and 30% of the 50 will switch from L to D. Thus
the total D vote will be
:70.550/ C:10.400/ C:30.50/ D385C40C15D440 (2)
Thus 44% of the vote next time will be for the D candidate. The calculation in (2) is
essentially the same as that used to compute the ﬁrst entry in x1. Analogous calculations
could be made for the other entries in x1, for the entries in x2, and so on.
Predicting the Distant Future
The most interesting aspect of Markov chains is the study of a chain’s long-term
behavior. For instance, what can be said in Example 2 about the voting after many
elections have passed (assuming that the given stochastic matrix continues to describe
the transition percentages from one election to the next)? Or, what happens to the pop-
ulation distribution in Example 1 “in the long run”? Before answering these questions,
we turn to a numerical example.

If the total population of the metropolitan region in Example 1 is 1 million, then
qfrom Example 4 would correspond to having 375,000 persons in the city and
625,000 in the suburbs. At the end of one year, the migration out of the city would
be.:05/.375;000/ D18;750 persons, and the migration intothe city from the suburbs
would be .:03/.625;000/ D18;750 persons. As a result, the population in the city would
remain the same. Similarly, the suburban population would be stable.
The next example shows how to ﬁnda steady-state vector.
EXAMPLE 5 LetPD:6 :3

Then x1D3

.
Next, choose a simple basis for the solution space. One obvious choice is3=4
1
but a better choice with no fractions is wD3

(corresponding to x2D4/.
Finally, ﬁnd a probability vector in the set of all solutions of PxDx. This process
is easy, since every solution is a multiple of the solution wabove. Divide wby the sum
of its entries and obtain
qD3=7

The next theorem shows that what happened in Example 3 is typical of many
stochastic matrices. We say that a stochastic matrix is regular if some matrix power
Pkcontains only strictly positive entries. For Pin Example 3,
P2D2
4:37 :26 :33
:45 :70 :45
:18 :04 :223

Since every entry in P2is strictly positive, Pis a regular stochastic matrix.
Also, we say that a sequence of vectors fxkWkD1; 2; : : : gconverges to a vector
qask! 1 if the entries in xkcan be made as close as desired to the corresponding
entries in qby taking ksufﬁciently large.

q. Further, if x0is any initial state and xkC1DPxkforkD0; 1; 2; : : : ; then the
Markov chain fxkgconverges to qask! 1 .
This theorem is proved in standard texts on Markov chains. The amazing part of the
theorem is that the initial state has no effect on the long-term behavior of the Markov
chain. You will see later (in Section 5.2) why this is true for several stochastic matrices
studied here.
EXAMPLE 6 In Example 2, what percentage of the voters are likely to vote for the
Republican candidate in some election many years from now, assuming that the election
outcomes form a Markov chain?
SOLUTION For computations by hand, the wrong approach is to pick some initial
vector x0and compute x1; : : : ; xkfor some large value of k. You have no way of knowing
how many vectors to compute, and you cannot be sure of the limiting values of the
entries in xk.
The correct approach is to compute the steady-state vector and then appeal to
Theorem 18. Given Pas in Example 2, form P Iby subtracting 1 from each diagonal
entry in P. Then row reduce the augmented matrix:
.P I/ 0D2
4 :3 :1 :3 0
:2 :2 :3 0
:1 :1  :6 03

each row by 10.1

The general solution of .P I/xD0isx1D9
4x3; x2D15
4x3, andx3is free. Choosing
x3D4, we obtain a basis for the solution space whose entries are integers, and from this
we easily ﬁnd the steady-state vector whose entries sum to 1:

The entries in qdescribe the distribution of votes at an election to be held many years
from now (assuming the stochastic matrix continues to describe the changes from one
election to the next). Thus, eventually, about 54% of the vote will be for the Republican
candidate.
1Warning: Don’t multiply only Pby 10. Instead, multiply the augmented matrix for equation
.P I/xD0by 10.

To compute a speciﬁc vector such as x3, fewer arithmetic operations are needed
to compute x1,x2, and x3, rather than P3andP3x0. However, if Pis small—say,
3030—the machine computation time is insigniﬁcant for both methods, and a
command to compute P3x0might be preferred because it requires fewer human
keystrokes.

1.A small remote village receives radio broadcasts from two
radio stations, a news station and a music station. Of the
listeners who are tuned to the news station, 70% will remain
listening to the news after the station break that occurs each
half hour, while 30% will switch to the music station at the
station break. Of the listeners who are tuned to the music
station, 60% will switch to the news station at the station
break, while 40% will remain listening to the music. Suppose

weather will be bad. If the weather is indifferent today, it will
be good tomorrow with probability .40 and indifferent with
probability .30. Finally, if the weather is bad today, it will
be good tomorrow with probability .40 and indifferent with
probability .50.

Demonstrate part of this statement by explaining (a) why
anmnmatrix Aof rank rhas an mrsubmatrix A1of

The concept of rank plays an important role in the design of
engineering control systems, such as the space shuttle system
mentioned in this chapter’s introductory example. A state-space
model of a control system includes a difference equation of the
form
xkC1DAxkCBukforkD0; 1; : : : (1)
where Aisnn,Bisnm,fxkgis a sequence of “state vectors”
inRnthat describe the state of the system at discrete times, and
fukgis acontrol , orinput , sequence. The pair .A; B/ is said to be
controllable if
rankBAB A2BAn 1BDn (2)
The matrix that appears in (2) is called the controllability matrix
for the system. If .A; B/ is controllable, then the system can be
controlled, or driven from the state 0to any speciﬁed state v(in
Rn) in at most nsteps, simply by choosing an appropriate control
sequence in Rm. This fact is illustrated in Exercise 18 for nD4andmD2. For a further discussion of controllability, see this

INTRODUCTORY EXAMPLE
Dynamical Systems and Spotted Owls
In 1990, the northern spotted owl became the center of
a nationwide controversy over the use and misuse of the
majestic forests in the Paciﬁc Northwest. Environmental-
ists convinced the federal government that the owl was
threatened with extinction if logging continued in the old-
growth forests (with trees more than 200 years old), where
the owls prefer to live. The timber industry, anticipating
the loss of 30,000 to 100,000 jobs as a result of new
government restrictions on logging, argued that the owl
should not be classiﬁed as a “threatened species” and cited
a number of published scientiﬁc reports to support its case.1
Caught in the crossﬁre of the two lobbying groups,
mathematical ecologists intensiﬁed their drive to under-
stand the population dynamics of the spotted owl. The life
cycle of a spotted owl divides naturally into three stages:
juvenile (up to 1 year old), subadult (1 to 2 years), and
adult (older than 2 years). The owls mate for life during
the subadult and adult stages, begin to breed as adults,
and live for up to 20 years. Each owl pair requires about
1000 hectares (4 square miles) for its own home territory.
A critical time in the life cycle is when the juveniles leave
the nest. To survive and become a subadult, a juvenile must
successfully ﬁnd a new home range (and usually a mate).
1“The Great Spotted Owl War,” Reader’ s Digest , November 1992,
pp. 91–95.A ﬁrst step in studying the population dynamics is to
model the population at yearly intervals, at times denoted
bykD0; 1; 2; : : : : Usually, one assumes that there is a 1:1
ratio of males to females in each life stage and counts only
the females. The population at year kcan be described
by a vector xkD.jk; sk; ak/, where jk,sk, and akare the
numbers of females in the juvenile, subadult, and adult
stages, respectively.
Using actual ﬁeld data from demographic studies,
R. Lamberson and co-workers considered the following
stage-matrix model :2

Here the number of new juvenile females in year kC1
is .33 times the number of adult females in year k(based
on the average birth rate per owl pair). Also, 18% of the
juveniles survive to become subadults, and 71% of the
subadults and 94% of the adults survive to be counted as
adults.
The stage-matrix model is a difference equation of the
form xkC1DAxk. Such an equation is often called a

dynamical system (or a discrete linear dynamical
system ) because it describes the changes in a system as
time passes.
The 18% juvenile survival rate in the Lamberson stage
matrix is the entry affected most by the amount of old-
growth forest available. Actually, 60% of the juveniles
normally survive to leave the nest, but in the Willow
Creek region of California studied by Lamberson and his
colleagues, only 30% of the juveniles that left the nest were
able to ﬁnd new home ranges. The rest perished during the
search process.A signiﬁcant reason for the failure of owls to ﬁnd new
home ranges is the increasing fragmentation of old-growth
timber stands due to clear-cutting of scattered areas on
the old-growth land. When an owl leaves the protective
canopy of the forest and crosses a clear-cut area, the risk of
attack by predators increases dramatically. Section 5.6 will
show that the model described above predicts the eventual
demise of the spotted owl, but that if 50% of the juveniles
who survive to leave the nest also ﬁnd new home ranges,
then the owl population will thrive.

The goal of this chapter is to dissect the action of a linear transformation x7!Axinto el-
ements that are easily visualized. Except for a brief digression in Section 5.4, all matrices
in the chapter are square. The main applications described here are to discrete dynamical
systems, including the spotted owls discussed above. However, the basic concepts—
eigenvectors and eigenvalues—are useful throughout pure and applied mathematics,
and they appear in settings far more general than we consider here. Eigenvalues are also
used to study differential equations and continuous dynamical systems, they provide
critical information in engineering design, and they arise naturally in ﬁelds such as
physics and chemistry.
5.1 EIGENVECTORS AND EIGENVALUES
Although a transformation x7!Axmay move vectors in a variety of directions, it often
happens that there are special vectors on which the action of Ais quite simple.

5.1 Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues 269
This section studies equations such as
AxD2xorAxD  4x
where special vectors are transformed by Ainto scalar multiples of themselves.
D E F I N I T I O N Aneigenvector of an nnmatrix Ais a nonzero vector xsuch that AxDx
for some scalar . A scalar is called an eigenvalue ofAif there is a nontrivial
solution xofAxDx; such an xis called an eigenvector corresponding to .1
It is easy to determine if a given vector is an eigenvector of a matrix. It is also easy
to decide if a speciﬁed scalar is an eigenvalue.

EXAMPLE 3 Show that 7 is an eigenvalue of matrix Ain Example 2, and ﬁnd the
corresponding eigenvectors.
SOLUTION The scalar 7 is an eigenvalue of Aif and only if the equation
AxD7x (1)
has a nontrivial solution. But (1) is equivalent to Ax 7xD0, or
.A 7I/xD0 (2)
To solve this homogeneous equation, form the matrix

The columns of A 7Iare obviously linearly dependent, so (2) has nontrivial solu-

operations: 6 6 0

eigenvector corresponding to D7.

the number 0 is an eigenvalue is discussed after Example 5.

270 CHAPTER 5 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Warning: Although row reduction was used in Example 3 to ﬁnd eigen vectors , it
cannot be used to ﬁnd eigen values . An echelon form of a matrix Ausually does not
display the eigenvalues of A.
The equivalence of equations (1) and (2) obviously holds for any in place of
D7. Thus is an eigenvalue of an nnmatrix Aif and only if the equation
.A I/xD0 (3)
has a nontrivial solution. The set of allsolutions of (3) is just the null space of the matrix
A I. So this set is a subspace ofRnand is called the eigenspace ofAcorresponding
to. The eigenspace consists of the zero vector and all the eigenvectors corresponding
to.
Example 3 shows that for matrix Ain Example 2, the eigenspace corresponding to
D7consists of allmultiples of .1; 1/ , which is the line through .1; 1/ and the origin.
From Example 2, you can check that the eigenspace corresponding to D  4is the
line through .6; 5/. These eigenspaces are shown in Figure 2, along with eigenvectors
.1; 1/ and.3=2; 5=4/ and the geometric action of the transformation x7!Axon each

Example 4 shows a good method for manual computation of eigenvectors in
simple cases when an eigenvalue is known. Using a matrix program and row
reduction to ﬁnd an eigenspace (for a speciﬁed eigenvalue) usually works, too,
but this is not entirely reliable. Roundoff error can lead occasionally to a reduced
echelon form with the wrong number of pivots. The best computer programs
compute approximations for eigenvalues and eigenvectors simultaneously, to
any desired degree of accuracy, for matrices that are not too large. The size
of matrices that can be analyzed increases each year as computing power and
software improve.
The following theorem describes one of the few special cases in which eigenvalues
can be found precisely. Calculation of eigenvalues will also be discussed in Section 5.2.

272 CHAPTER 5 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
The scalar is an eigenvalue of Aif and only if the equation .A I/xD0has a
nontrivial solution, that is, if and only if the equation has a free variable. Because of the
zero entries in A I, it is easy to see that .A I/xD0has a free variable if and
only if at least one of the entries on the diagonal of A Iis zero. This happens if and
only if equals one of the entries a11,a22,a33inA. For the case in which Ais lower
triangular, see Exercise 28.

5. The eigenval-
ues of Aare 3, 0, and 2. The eigenvalues of Bare 4 and 1.
What does it mean for a matrix Ato have an eigenvalue of 0, such as in Example 5?
This happens if and only if the equation
AxD0x (4)
has a nontrivial solution. But (4) is equivalent to AxD0, which has a nontrivial solution
if and only if Ais not invertible. Thus 0 is an eigenvalue of Aif and only if Ais not
invertible . This fact will be added to the Invertible Matrix Theorem in Section 5.2.
The following important theorem will be needed later. Its proof illustrates a typical
calculation with eigenvectors. One way to prove the statement “If PthenQ” is to show
thatPand the negation of Qleads to a contradiction. This strategy is used in the proof
of the theorem.
T H E O R E M 2 Ifv1; : : : ; vrare eigenvectors that correspond to distinct eigenvalues 1; : : : ;  r
of an nnmatrix A, then the set fv1; : : : ; vrgis linearly independent.
PROOF Suppose fv1; : : : ; vrgis linearly dependent. Since v1is nonzero, Theorem 7 in
Section 1.7 says that one of the vectors in the set is a linear combination of the preceding
vectors. Let pbe the least index such that vpC1is a linear combination of the preceding
(linearly independent) vectors. Then there exist scalars c1; : : : ; c psuch that
c1v1C  C cpvpDvpC1 (5)
Multiplying both sides of (5) by Aand using the fact that AvkDkvkfor each k, we
obtain
c1Av1C  C cpAvpDAvpC1
c11v1C  C cppvpDpC1vpC1 (6)
Multiplying both sides of (5) by pC1and subtracting the result from (6), we have
c1.1 pC1/v1C  C cp.p pC1/vpD0 (7)
Sincefv1; : : : ; vpgis linearly independent, the weights in (7) are all zero. But none of
the factors i pC1are zero, because the eigenvalues are distinct. Hence ciD0for
iD1; : : : ; p . But then (5) says that vpC1D0, which is impossible. Hence fv1; : : : ; vrg
cannot be linearly dependent and therefore must be linearly independent.

Eigenvectors and Difference Equations
This section concludes by showing how to construct solutions of the ﬁrst-order differ-
ence equation discussed in the chapter introductory example:
xkC1DAxk.kD0; 1; 2; : : :/ (8)
IfAis an nnmatrix, then (8) is a recursive description of a sequence fxkginRn.
Asolution of (8) is an explicit description of fxkgwhose formula for each xkdoes not
depend directly on Aor on the preceding terms in the sequence other than the initial
term x0.
The simplest way to build a solution of (8) is to take an eigenvector x0and its
corresponding eigenvalue and let
xkDkx0.kD1; 2; : : :/ (9)
This sequence is a solution because
AxkDA.kx0/Dk.Ax0/Dk.x0/DkC1x0DxkC1

3.Yes. Suppose c1b1Cc2b2C.c3b3Cc4b4/D0. Since any linear combination of
eigenvectors corresponding to the same eigenvalue is in the eigenspace for that
eigenvalue, c3b3Cc4b4is either 0or an eigenvector for 3. Ifc3b3Cc4b4were
an eigenvector for 3, then by Theorem 2, fb1;b2; c3b3Cc4b4gwould be a linearly
independent set, which would force c1Dc2D0andc3b3Cc4b4D0, contradicting
thatc3b3Cc4b4is an eigenvector. Thus c3b3Cc4b4must be 0, implying that
c1b1Cc2b2D0also. By Theorem 2, fb1;b2gis a linearly independent set so
c1Dc2D0. Moreover, fb3;b4gis a linearly independent set so c3Dc4D0. Since
all of the coefﬁcients c1,c2,c3, and c4must be zero, it follows that fb1,b2,b3,b4g
is a linearly independent set.

4.Since is an eigenvalue of A, there is a nonzero vector xinRnsuch that AxDx.

Thus .2A/ xD.2/xand hence 2is an eigenvalue of 2A.
5.2 THE CHARACTERISTIC EQUATION
Useful information about the eigenvalues of a square matrix Ais encoded in a special
scalar equation called the characteristic equation of A. A simple example will lead to
the general case.
EXAMPLE 1 Find the eigenvalues of AD2 3
3 6
.
SOLUTION We must ﬁnd all scalars such that the matrix equation
.A I/xD0
has a nontrivial solution. By the Invertible Matrix Theorem in Section 2.3, this problem
is equivalent to ﬁnding all such that the matrix A Iisnotinvertible, where
A ID2 3
3 6
  0
0 
D2  3
3 6 
By Theorem 4 in Section 2.2, this matrix fails to be invertible precisely when its
determinant is zero. So the eigenvalues of Aare the solutions of the equation
det.A I/Ddet2  3
3 6 
D0
Recall that
deta b

So
det.A I/D.2 /. 6 / .3/.3/
D  12C6 2C2 9
D2C4 21
D. 3/.C7/
If det .A I/D0, then D3orD  7. So the eigenvalues of Aare 3 and  7.
The determinant in Example 1 transformed the matrix equation .A I/xD0,
which involves twounknowns .andx/, into the scalar equation 2C4 21D0,
which involves only one unknown. The same idea works for nnmatrices. However,
before turning to larger matrices, we summarize the properties of determinants needed
to study eigenvalues.
Determinants
LetAbe an nnmatrix, let Ube any echelon form obtained from Aby row
replacements and row interchanges (without scaling), and let rbe the number of such
row interchanges. Then the determinant ofA, written as det A, is. 1/rtimes the
product of the diagonal entries u11; : : : ; u nninU. IfAis invertible, then u11; : : : ; u nn

41 5 0
0 2 0
0 0  13
5DU1
So det Aequals . 1/1.1/. 2/. 1/D  2. The following alternative row reduction
avoids the row interchange and produces a different echelon form. The last step adds
 1=3times row 2 to row 3:
A2
41 5 0

0 2 03

0 0 1=33
5DU2
This time det Ais. 1/0.1/. 6/.1=3/ D  2, the same as before.
Formula (1) for the determinant shows that Ais invertible if and only if det Ais
nonzero. This fact, and the characterization of invertibility found in Section 5.1, can be
added to the Invertible Matrix Theorem.
T H E O R E M The Invertible Matrix Theorem (continued)
LetAbe an nnmatrix. Then Ais invertible if and only if:
s.The number 0 is notan eigenvalue of A.
t.The determinant of Aisnotzero.
When Ais a33matrix, jdetAjturns out to be the volume of the parallelepiped
determined by the columns a1,a2, and a3ofA, as in Figure 1. (See Section 3.3 for
details.) This volume is nonzero if and only if the vectors a1,a2, and a3are linearly
independent, in which case the matrix Ais invertible. (If the vectors are nonzero and
linearly dependent, they lie in a plane or along a line.)
The next theorem lists facts needed from Sections 3.1 and 3.2. Part (a) is included
here for convenient reference.

without scaling gives the same value for det A.

The Characteristic Equation
Theorem 3(a) shows how to determine when a matrix of the form A Iisnot
invertible. The scalar equation det .A I/D0is called the characteristic equation
ofA, and the argument in Example 1 justiﬁes the following fact.
A scalar is an eigenvalue of an nnmatrix Aif and only if satisﬁes the
characteristic equation

Expanding the product, we can also write

In Examples 1 and 3, det .A I/is a polynomial in . It can be shown that if Ais
annnmatrix, then det .A I/is a polynomial of degree ncalled the characteristic
polynomial ofA.
The eigenvalue 5 in Example 3 is said to have multiplicity 2 because . 5/
occurs two times as a factor of the characteristic polynomial. In general, the ( algebraic )
multiplicity of an eigenvalue is its multiplicity as a root of the characteristic equation.

Find the eigenvalues and their multiplicities.
SOLUTION Factor the polynomial
6 45 124D4.2 4 12/D4. 6/.C2/
The eigenvalues are 0 (multiplicity 4), 6 (multiplicity 1), and  2(multiplicity 1).
We could also list the eigenvalues in Example 4 as 0; 0; 0; 0; 6 , and 2, so that the
eigenvalues are repeated according to their multiplicities.
Because the characteristic equation for an nnmatrix involves an nth-degree
polynomial, the equation has exactly nroots, counting multiplicities, provided complex
roots are allowed. Such complex roots, called complex eigenvalues , will be discussed
in Section 5.5. Until then, we consider only real eigenvalues, and scalars will continue
to be real numbers.
The characteristic equation is important for theoretical purposes. In practical work,
however, eigenvalues of any matrix larger than 22should be found by a computer,
unless the matrix is triangular or has other special properties. Although a 33charac-
teristic polynomial is easy to compute by hand, factoring it can be difﬁcult (unless the
matrix is carefully chosen). See the Numerical Notes at the end of this section.

Similarity
The next theorem illustrates one use of the characteristic polynomial, and it provides
the foundation for several iterative methods that approximate eigenvalues. If Aand
Barennmatrices, then Ais similar to Bif there is an invertible matrix P
such that P 1APDB, or, equivalently, ADPBP 1. Writing QforP 1, we have
Q 1BQDA. SoBis also similar to A, and we say simply that AandBare similar .
Changing AintoP 1APis called a similarity transformation .
T H E O R E M 4 Ifnnmatrices AandBare similar, then they have the same characteristic
polynomial and hence the same eigenvalues (with the same multiplicities).

Since det .P 1/det.P /Ddet.P 1P /DdetID1, we see from equation (2) that
det.B I/Ddet.A I/.

1.The matrices 2 1

and2 0

are not similar even though they have the same eigenvalues.
2.Similarity is not the same as row equivalence. (If Ais row equivalent to B, then
BDEAfor some invertible matrix E.) Row operations on a matrix usually
change its eigenvalues.

1.Computer software such as Mathematica and Maple can use symbolic calcu-
lations to ﬁnd the characteristic polynomial of a moderate-sized matrix. But
there is no formula or ﬁnite algorithm to solve the characteristic equation of a
general nnmatrix for n5.
2.The best numerical methods for ﬁnding eigenvalues avoid the characteristic

3.Several common algorithms for estimating the eigenvalues of a matrix A

Each matrix in the sequence is similar to Aand so has the same eigenvalues

5.3 DIAGONALIZATION
In many cases, the eigenvalue–eigenvector information contained within a matrix Acan
be displayed in a useful factorization of the form ADPDP 1where Dis a diagonal ma-
trix. In this section, the factorization enables us to compute Akquickly for large values
ofk, a fundamental idea in several applications of linear algebra. Later, in Sections 5.6
and 5.7, the factorization will be used to analyze (and decouple ) dynamical systems.
The following example illustrates that powers of a diagonal matrix are easy to
compute.

A square matrix Ais said to be diagonalizable ifAis similar to a diagonal matrix,
that is, if ADPDP 1for some invertible matrix Pand some diagonal matrix D.
The next theorem gives a characterization of diagonalizable matrices and tells how to
construct a suitable factorization.
T H E O R E M 5 The Diagonalization Theorem
Annnmatrix Ais diagonalizable if and only if Ahasnlinearly independent
eigenvectors.
In fact, ADPDP 1, with Da diagonal matrix, if and only if the columns of
Parenlinearly independent eigenvectors of A. In this case, the diagonal entries
ofDare eigenvalues of Athat correspond, respectively, to the eigenvectors in P.
In other words, Ais diagonalizable if and only if there are enough eigenvectors to
form a basis of Rn. We call such a basis an eigenvector basis ofRn.
PROOF First, observe that if Pis any nnmatrix with columns v1; : : : ; vn, and if D
is any diagonal matrix with diagonal entries 1; : : : ;  n, then

5.3 Diagonalization 285
Now suppose Ais diagonalizable and ADPDP 1. Then right-multiplying this relation
byP, we have APDPD. In this case, equations (1) and (2) imply that
Av1Av2AvnD1v12v2nvn (3)
Equating columns, we ﬁnd that
Av1D1v1; A v2D2v2; : : : ; A vnDnvn (4)
Since Pis invertible, its columns v1; : : : ; vnmust be linearly independent. Also, since
these columns are nonzero, the equations in (4) show that 1; : : : ;  nare eigenvalues
andv1; : : : ; vnare corresponding eigenvectors. This argument proves the “only if” parts
of the ﬁrst and second statements, along with the third statement, of the theorem.
Finally, given any neigenvectors v1; : : : ; vn, use them to construct the columns
ofPand use corresponding eigenvalues 1; : : : ;  nto construct D. By equations (1)–
(3),APDPD. This is true without any condition on the eigenvectors. If, in fact, the
eigenvectors are linearly independent, then Pis invertible (by the Invertible Matrix
Theorem), and APDPDimplies that ADPDP 1.

That is, ﬁnd an invertible matrix Pand a diagonal matrix Dsuch that ADPDP 1.
SOLUTION There are four steps to implement the description in Theorem 5.
Step 1 .Find the eigenvalues of A. As mentioned in Section 5.2, the mechanics of
this step are appropriate for a computer when the matrix is larger than 22. To avoid
unnecessary distractions, the text will usually supply information needed for this step.
In the present case, the characteristic equation turns out to involve a cubic polynomial
that can be factored:
0Ddet.A I/D  3 32C4
D  . 1/.C2/2
The eigenvalues are D1andD  2.
Step 2 .Find three linearly independent eigenvectors of A. Three vectors are needed
because Ais a33matrix. This is the critical step. If it fails, then Theorem 5 says
thatAcannot be diagonalized. The method in Section 5.1 produces a basis for each
eigenspace:

Step 4 .Construct D from the corresponding eigenvalues. In this step, it is essential that
the order of the eigenvalues matches the order chosen for the columns of P. Use the
eigenvalue D  2twice, once for each of the eigenvectors corresponding to D  2:
DD2

It is a good idea to check that PandDreally work. To avoid computing P 1,
simply verify that APDPD. This is equivalent to ADPDP 1when Pis invertible.

There are no other eigenvalues, and every eigenvector of Ais a multiple of either v1
orv2. Hence it is impossible to construct a basis of R3using eigenvectors of A. By
Theorem 5, Aisnotdiagonalizable.
The following theorem provides a sufﬁcient condition for a matrix to be
diagonalizable.
T H E O R E M 6 Annnmatrix with ndistinct eigenvalues is diagonalizable.

5.3 Diagonalization 287
PROOF Letv1; : : : ; vnbe eigenvectors corresponding to the ndistinct eigenvalues of
a matrix A. Then fv1; : : : ; vngis linearly independent, by Theorem 2 in Section 5.1.
Hence Ais diagonalizable, by Theorem 5.
It is not necessary for an nnmatrix to have ndistinct eigenvalues in order to be
diagonalizable. The 33matrix in Example 3 is diagonalizable even though it has only
two distinct eigenvalues.
EXAMPLE 5 Determine if the following matrix is diagonalizable.

SOLUTION This is easy! Since the matrix is triangular, its eigenvalues are obviously 5,
0, and 2. Since Ais a33matrix with three distinct eigenvalues, Ais diagonalizable.
Matrices Whose Eigenvalues Are Not Distinct
If annnmatrix Ahasndistinct eigenvalues, with corresponding eigenvectors v1; : : : ;
vn, and if PDv1 vn, then Pis automatically invertible because its columns
are linearly independent, by Theorem 2. When Ais diagonalizable but has fewer than n
distinct eigenvalues, it is still possible to build Pin a way that makes Pautomatically
invertible, as the next theorem shows.1
T H E O R E M 7 LetAbe an nnmatrix whose distinct eigenvalues are 1; : : : ;  p.
a.For1kp, the dimension of the eigenspace for kis less than or equal to
the multiplicity of the eigenvalue k.
b.The matrix Ais diagonalizable if and only if the sum of the dimensions of
the eigenspaces equals n, and this happens if and only if ( i) the characteristic
polynomial factors completely into linear factors and ( ii) the dimension of the
eigenspace for each kequals the multiplicity of k.
c.IfAis diagonalizable and Bkis a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to k
for each k, then the total collection of vectors in the sets B1; : : : ;Bpforms an
eigenvector basis for Rn.

Theorem 2 and Practice Problem 3 in Section 5.1. There can be no additional
eigenvectors that are linearly independent from v1,v2,v3,v4, because the vectors are
all inR4. Hence the eigenspaces for D5andD  2are both one-dimensional.
It follows that Ais diagonalizable by Theorem 7(b).

5.4 EIGENVECTORS AND LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
The goal of this section is to understand the matrix factorization ADPDP 1as a
statement about linear transformations. We shall see that the transformation x7!Ax
is essentially the same as the very simple mapping u7!Du, when viewed from the
proper perspective. A similar interpretation will apply to AandDeven when Dis not
a diagonal matrix.
Recall from Section 1.9 that any linear transformation TfromRntoRmcan be
implemented via left-multiplication by a matrix A, called the standard matrix ofT.
Now we need the same sort of representation for any linear transformation between two
ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces.

The Matrix of a Linear Transformation
LetVbe an n-dimensional vector space, let Wbe an m-dimensional vector space, and
letTbe any linear transformation from VtoW. To associate a matrix with T, choose
(ordered) bases BandCforVandW, respectively.
Given any xinV, the coordinate vector xBis inRnand the coordinate vector of
its image, T .x/C, is inRm, as shown in Figure 1.

Linear Transformations on Rn
In an applied problem involving Rn, a linear transformation Tusually appears ﬁrst as
a matrix transformation, x7!Ax. IfAis diagonalizable, then there is a basis BforRn
consisting of eigenvectors of A. Theorem 8 below shows that, in this case, the B-matrix
forTis diagonal. Diagonalizing Aamounts to ﬁnding a diagonal matrix representation
ofx7!Ax.

Similarity of Matrix Representations
The proof of Theorem 8 did not use the information that Dwas diagonal. Hence,
ifAis similar to a matrix C, with ADP CP 1, then Cis the B-matrix for the
transformation x7!Axwhen the basis Bis formed from the columns of P. The

Theorem 8 show that if Pis the matrix whose columns come from the vectors in B,

5.5 COMPLEX EIGENVALUES
Since the characteristic equation of an nnmatrix involves a polynomial of degree n,
the equation always has exactly nroots, counting multiplicities, provided that possibly
complex roots are included . This section shows that if the characteristic equation of
a real matrix Ahas some complex roots, then these roots provide critical information
about A. The key is to let Aact on the space Cnofn-tuples of complex numbers.1
Our interest in Cndoes not arise from a desire to “generalize” the results of the
earlier chapters, although that would in fact open up signiﬁcant new applications of
linear algebra.2Rather, this study of complex eigenvalues is essential in order to uncover
“hidden” information about certain matrices with real entries that arise in a variety of
real-life problems. Such problems include many real dynamical systems that involve
periodic motion, vibration, or some type of rotation in space.
The matrix eigenvalue–eigenvector theory already developed for Rnapplies
equally well to Cn. So a complex scalar satisﬁes det .A I/D0if and only if there
is a nonzero vector xinCnsuch that AxDx. We call a (complex )eigenvalue and
xa (complex )eigenvector corresponding to .

, then the linear transformation x7!AxonR2
rotates the plane counterclockwise through a quarter-turn. The action of Ais periodic,
since after four quarter-turns, a vector is back where it started. Obviously, no nonzero
vector is mapped into a multiple of itself, so Ahas no eigenvectors in R2and hence no
real eigenvalues. In fact, the characteristic equation of Ais

. :3C:6i/x 1  :6x2D0
:75x 1C.:3C:6i/x 2D0(2)
has a nontrivial solution (with x1andx2possibly complex numbers). Therefore, both
equations in (2) determine the same relationship between x1andx2, and either equation
can be used to express one variable in terms of the other .3

Hence is also an eigenvalue of A, with xa corresponding eigenvector. This shows that
when Ais real, its complex eigenvalues occur in conjugate pairs . (Here and elsewhere,
we use the term complex eigenvalue to refer to an eigenvalue DaCbi, with b¤0.)

5.6 DISCRETE DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide the key to understanding the long-term behavior,
orevolution , of a dynamical system described by a difference equation xkC1DAxk.
Such an equation was used to model population movement in Section 1.10, various
Markov chains in Section 4.9, and the spotted owl population in the introductory
example for this chapter. The vectors xkgive information about the system as time
(denoted by k) passes. In the spotted owl example, for instance, xklisted the numbers
of owls in three age classes at time k.
The applications in this section focus on ecological problems because they are easier
to state and explain than, say, problems in physics or engineering. However, dynamical
systems arise in many scientiﬁc ﬁelds. For instance, standard undergraduate courses
in control systems discuss several aspects of dynamical systems. The modern state-
space design method in such courses relies heavily on matrix algebra.1Thesteady-state
response of a control system is the engineering equivalent of what we call here the
“long-term behavior” of the dynamical system xkC1DAxk.
1See G. F. Franklin, J. D. Powell, and A. Emami-Naeimi, Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems , 5th ed.
(Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 2006). This undergraduate text has a nice introduction to dynamic
models (Chapter 2). State-space design is covered in Chapters 7 and 8.

A Predator–Prey System
Deep in the redwood forests of California, dusky-footed wood rats provide up to 80% of
the diet for the spotted owl, the main predator of the wood rat. Example 1 uses a linear
dynamical system to model the physical system of the owls and the rats. (Admittedly,
the model is unrealistic in several respects, but it can provide a starting point for the
study of more complicated nonlinear models used by environmental scientists.)
EXAMPLE 1 Denote the owl and wood rat populations at time kbyxkDOk
Rk
,
where kis the time in months, Okis the number of owls in the region studied, and Rk
is the number of rats (measured in thousands). Suppose

RkC1D  pOkC.1:1/R k(3)
where pis a positive parameter to be speciﬁed. The .:5/O kin the ﬁrst equation says
that with no wood rats for food, only half of the owls will survive each month, while the
.1:1/R kin the second equation says that with no owls as predators, the rat population
will grow by 10% per month. If rats are plentiful, the .:4/R kwill tend to make the
owl population rise, while the negative term  pOkmeasures the deaths of rats due
to predation by owls. (In fact, 1000p is the average number of rats eaten by one owl in
one month.) Determine the evolution of this system when the predation parameter pis
.104.

The approximation in (5) says that eventually both entries of xk(the numbers of owls

(4),xkis approximately a multiple of .10; 13/ , so the entries in xkare nearly in the same
ratio as 10 to 13. That is, for every 10 owls there are about 13 thousand rats.
Example 1 illustrates two general facts about a dynamical system xkC1DAxkin
which Aisnn, its eigenvalues satisfy j1j 1and1 >jjjforjD2; : : : ; n , and v1
is an eigenvector corresponding to 1. Ifx0is given by equation (1), with c1¤0, then
for all sufﬁciently large k,
xkC11xk (6)
and
xkc1.1/kv1 (7)
The approximations in (6) and (7) can be made as close as desired by taking k
sufﬁciently large. By (6), the xkeventually grow almost by a factor of 1each time,
so1determines the eventual growth rate of the system. Also, by (7), the ratio of any
two entries in xk(for large k) is nearly the same as the ratio of the corresponding entries
inv1. The case in which 1D1is illustrated in Example 5 in Section 5.2.
Graphical Description of Solutions
When Ais22, algebraic calculations can be supplemented by a geometric description
of a system’s evolution. We can view the equation xkC1DAxkas a description of what
happens to an initial point x0inR2as it is transformed repeatedly by the mapping
x7!Ax. The graph of x0;x1; : : :is called a trajectory of the dynamical system.

each trajectory are connected by a thin curve, to make the trajectory easier to see.

FIGURE 1 The origin as an attractor.
In Example 2, the origin is called an attractor of the dynamical system because
all trajectories tend toward 0. This occurs whenever both eigenvalues are less than 1
in magnitude. The direction of greatest attraction is along the line through 0and the
eigenvector v2for the eigenvalue of smaller magnitude.
In the next example, both eigenvalues of Aare larger than 1 in magnitude, and 0
is called a repeller of the dynamical system. All solutions of xkC1DAxkexcept the
(constant) zero solution are unbounded and tend away from the origin.2

2The origin is the only possible attractor or repeller in a linear dynamical system, but there can be multiple
attractors and repellers in a more general dynamical system for which the mapping xk7!xkC1is not linear.
In such a system, attractors and repellers are deﬁned in terms of the eigenvalues of a special matrix (with
variable entries) called the Jacobian matrix of the system.

Both terms grow in size, but the ﬁrst term grows faster. So the direction of greatest re-
pulsion is the line through 0and the eigenvector for the eigenvalue of larger magnitude.
Figure 2 shows several trajectories that begin at points quite close to 0.
In the next example, 0is called a saddle point because the origin attracts solutions
from some directions and repels them in other directions. This occurs whenever one
eigenvalue is greater than 1 in magnitude and the other is less than 1 in magnitude. The
direction of greatest attraction is determined by an eigenvector for the eigenvalue of
smaller magnitude. The direction of greatest repulsion is determined by an eigenvector
for the eigenvalue of greater magnitude.

Change of Variable
The preceding three examples involved diagonal matrices. To handle the nondiagonal

with the corresponding eigenvalues on the diagonal. Given a sequence fxkgsatisfying
xkC1DAxk, deﬁne a new sequence fykgby
ykDP 1xk;or equivalently ;xkDPyk
Substituting these relations into the equation xkC1DAxkand using the fact that AD

Left-multiplying both sides by P 1, we obtain

The equation xkDPyksays that ykis the coordinate vector of xkwith respect to

calculations in the new eigenvector coordinate system. When nD2, this amounts to

Movement along these axes corresponds to movement along the standard axes in
Figure 3. In Figure 4, the direction of greatest repulsion is the line through 0and the
eigenvector v1whose eigenvalue is greater than 1 in magnitude. If x0is on this line, the
c2in (9) is zero and xkmoves quickly away from 0. The direction of greatest attraction
is determined by the eigenvector v2whose eigenvalue is less than 1 in magnitude.
A number of trajectories are shown in Figure 4. When this graph is viewed in
terms of the eigenvector axes, the picture “looks” essentially the same as the picture
in Figure 3.

Complex Eigenvalues
When a real 22matrix Ahas complex eigenvalues, Ais not diagonalizable (when
acting on R2/, but the dynamical system xkC1DAxkis easy to describe. Example 3
of Section 5.5 illustrated the case in which the eigenvalues have absolute value 1. The
iterates of a point x0spiraled around the origin along an elliptical trajectory.
IfAhas two complex eigenvalues whose absolute value is greater than 1, then 0is
a repeller and iterates of x0will spiral outward around the origin. If the absolute values
of the complex eigenvalues are less than 1, then the origin is an attractor and the iterates
ofx0spiral inward toward the origin, as in the following example.

Survival of the Spotted Owls
Recall from this chapter’s introductory example that the spotted owl population in the
Willow Creek area of California was modeled by a dynamical system xkC1DAxkin
which the entries in xkD.jk; sk; ak/listed the numbers of females (at time k) in the
juvenile, subadult, and adult life stages, respectively, and Ais the stage-matrix

FIGURE 5 Rotation associated with complex
eigenvalues.
MATLAB shows that the eigenvalues of Aare approximately 1D:98,
2D  :02C:21i, and 3D  :02 :21i. Observe that all three eigenvalues are
less than 1 in magnitude, because j2j2D j3j2D. :02/2C.:21/2D:0445 .
For the moment, let Aact on the complex vector space C3. Then, because Ahas
three distinct eigenvalues, the three corresponding eigenvectors are linearly independent
and form a basis for C3. Denote the eigenvectors by v1,v2, and v3. Then the general
solution of xkC1DAxk(using vectors in C3) has the form
xkDc1.1/kv1Cc2.2/kv2Cc3.3/kv3 (11)
Ifx0is a real initial vector, then x1DAx0is real because Ais real. Similarly, the
equation xkC1DAxkshows that each xkon the left side of (11) is real, even though
it is expressed as a sum of complex vectors. However, each term on the right side
of (11) is approaching the zero vector, because the eigenvalues are all less than 1 in
magnitude. Therefore the real sequence xkapproaches the zero vector, too. Sadly, this
model predicts that the spotted owls will eventually all perish.
Is there hope for the spotted owl? Recall from the introductory example that the
18% entry in the matrix Ain (10) comes from the fact that although 60% of the juvenile
owls live long enough to leave the nest and search for new home territories, only 30%
of that group survive the search and ﬁnd new home ranges. Search survival is strongly
inﬂuenced by the number of clear-cut areas in the forest, which make the search more
difﬁcult and dangerous.
Some owl populations live in areas with few or no clear-cut areas. It may be that
a larger percentage of the juvenile owls there survive and ﬁnd new home ranges. Of
course, the problem of the spotted owl is more complex than we have described, but the
ﬁnal example provides a happy ending to the story.
EXAMPLE 7 Suppose the search survival rate of the juvenile owls is 50%, so the
.2; 1/ -entry in the stage-matrix Ain (10) is .3 instead of .18. What does the stage-matrix
model predict about this spotted owl population?
SOLUTION Now the eigenvalues of Aturn out to be approximately 1D1:01,2D
 :03C:26i, and 3D  :03 :26i. An eigenvector for 1is approximately v1D
.10; 3; 31/ . Let v2and v3be (complex) eigenvectors for 2and3. In this case,

equation (11) becomes
xkDc1.1:01/kv1Cc2. :03C:26i/kv2Cc3. :03 :26i/kv3
Ask! 1 , the second two vectors tend to zero. So xkbecomes more and more like
the (real) vector c1.1:01/kv1. The approximations in equations (6) and (7), following
Example 1, apply here. Also, it can be shown that the constant c1in the initial
decomposition of x0is positive when the entries in x0are nonnegative. Thus the owl
population will grow slowly, with a long-term growth rate of 1.01. The eigenvector v1
describes the eventual distribution of the owls by life stages: for every 31 adults, there
will be about 10 juveniles and 3 subadults.

314 CHAPTER 5 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
(Engineers call this property superposition of solutions.) Also, the identically zero
function is a (trivial) solution of (1). In the terminology of Chapter 4, the set of all
solutions of (1) is a subspace of the set of all continuous functions with values in Rn.
Standard texts on differential equations show that there always exists what is called
afundamental set of solutions to (1). If Aisnn, then there are nlinearly independent
functions in a fundamental set, and each solution of (1) is a unique linear combination
of these nfunctions. That is, a fundamental set of solutions is a basis for the set of
all solutions of (1), and the solution set is an n-dimensional vector space of functions.
If a vector x0is speciﬁed, then the initial value problem is to construct the (unique)
function xsuch that x0DAxandx.0/Dx0.
When Ais a diagonal matrix, the solutions of (1) can be produced by elementary
calculus. For instance, consider

that is,

2.t/D  5x2.t/(3)
The system (2) is said to be decoupled because each derivative of a function depends
only on the function itself, not on some combination or “coupling” of both x1.t/and
x2.t/. From calculus, the solutions of (3) are x1.t/Dc1e3tandx2.t/Dc2e 5t, for any
constants c1andc2. Each solution of equation (2) can be written in the form

This example suggests that for the general equation x0DAx, a solution might be a
linear combination of functions of the form
x.t/Dvet(4)
for some scalar and some ﬁxed nonzero vector v. [If vD0, the function x.t/is
identically zero and hence satisﬁes x0DAx.] Observe that

ifis an eigenvalue of Aandvis a corresponding eigenvector. Thus each eigenvalue–
eigenvector pair provides a solution (4) of x0DAx. Such solutions are sometimes called
eigenfunctions of the differential equation. Eigenfunctions provide the key to solving
systems of differential equations.

316 CHAPTER 5 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
In Figure 2, the origin is called an attractor , orsink, of the dynamical system
because all trajectories are drawn into the origin. The direction of greatest attraction
is along the trajectory of the eigenfunction x2(along the line through 0and v2/
corresponding to the more negative eigenvalue, D  2. Trajectories that begin at points
not on this line become asymptotic to the line through 0andv1because their components
in the v2direction decay so rapidly.
If the eigenvalues in Example 1 were positive instead of negative, the corresponding
trajectories would be similar in shape, but the trajectories would be traversed away from
the origin. In such a case, the origin is called a repeller , orsource , of the dynamical
system, and the direction of greatest repulsion is the line containing the trajectory of the
eigenfunction corresponding to the more positive eigenvalue.

In Figure 3, the origin is called a saddle point of the dynamical system because
some trajectories approach the origin at ﬁrst and then change direction and move away

negative eigenvalues. The direction of greatest repulsion is the line through v1and0,

In the next example, a real matrix Ahas a pair of complex eigenvalues and, with
associated complex eigenvectors vandv. (Recall from Section 5.5 that for a real matrix,
complex eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors come in conjugate pairs.) So two

It can be shown that x2.t/Dx1.t/by using a power series representation for the

The origin as a spiral point.
In Figure 5, the origin is called a spiral point of the dynamical system. The rotation
is caused by the sine and cosine functions that arise from a complex eigenvalue. The
trajectories spiral inward because the factor e 2ttends to zero. Recall that  2is the real
part of the eigenvalue in Example 3. When Ahas a complex eigenvalue with positive
real part, the trajectories spiral outward. If the real part of the eigenvalue is zero, the
trajectories form ellipses around the origin.

3.Any solution with c2Dc3D0is attracted to the origin because of the negative
exponential factor. Other solutions have components that grow without bound, and
the trajectories spiral outward.
Be careful not to mistake this problem for one in Section 5.6. There the condition
for attraction toward 0was that an eigenvalue be less than 1 in magnitude, to make
jjk!0. Here the real part of the eigenvalue must be negative, to make et!0.
5.8 ITERATIVE ESTIMATES FOR EIGENVALUES
In scientiﬁc applications of linear algebra, eigenvalues are seldom known precisely.
Fortunately, a close numerical approximation is usually quite satisfactory. In fact, some
applications require only a rough approximation to the largest eigenvalue. The ﬁrst
algorithm described below can work well for this case. Also, it provides a foundation
for a more powerful method that can give fast estimates for other eigenvalues as well.
The Power Method
The power method applies to an nnmatrix Awith a strictly dominant eigenvalue
1, which means that 1must be larger in absolute value than all the other eigenvalues.
In this case, the power method produces a scalar sequence that approaches 1and a
vector sequence that approaches a corresponding eigenvector. The background for the
method rests on the eigenvector decomposition used at the beginning of Section 5.6.
Assume for simplicity that Ais diagonalizable and Rnhas a basis of eigenvectors
v1; : : : ; vn, arranged so their corresponding eigenvalues 1; : : : ;  ndecrease in size, with
the strictly dominant eigenvalue ﬁrst. That is,

322 CHAPTER 5 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Thus, for large k, a scalar multiple of Akxdetermines almost the same direction as the
eigenvector c1v1. Since positive scalar multiples do not change the direction of a vector,
Akxitself points almost in the same direction as v1or v1, provided c1¤0.

too long to display. However, line segments are drawn showing the directions of those
vectors. In fact, the directions of the vectors are what we really want to see, not the vec-
tors themselves. The lines seem to be approaching the line representing the eigenspace
spanned by v1. More precisely, the angle between the line (subspace) determined by
Akxand the line (eigenspace) determined by v1goes to zero as k! 1 .

converge to a multiple of v1whose largest entry is 1. Figure 2 shows the scaled sequence

xkis close to an eigenvector for 1, the vector Axkis close to 1xk, with each entry in

The evidence from Table 2 strongly suggests that fxkgapproaches .1; :2/ andfkg

The sequence fkgin Example 2 converged quickly to 1D7because the second
eigenvalue of Awas much smaller. (In fact, 2D1.) In general, the rate of convergence
depends on the ratio j2=1j, because the vector c2.2=1/kv2in equation (2) is the main
source of error when using a scaled version of Akxas an estimate of c1v1. (The other
fractions j=1are likely to be smaller.) If j2=1jis close to 1, then fkgandfxkgcan
converge very slowly, and other approximation methods may be preferred.
With the power method, there is a slight chance that the chosen initial vector x
will have no component in the v1direction (when c1D0). But computer rounding
errors during the calculations of the xkare likely to create a vector with at least a small
component in the direction of v1. If that occurs, the xkwill start to converge to a multiple
ofv1.
The Inverse Power Method
This method provides an approximation for anyeigenvalue, provided a good initial
estimate of the eigenvalue is known. In this case, we let BD.A I/ 1and apply
the power method to B. It can be shown that if the eigenvalues of Aare1; : : : ;  n, then
the eigenvalues of Bare
1
1 ;1
2 ; : : : ;1
n 
and the corresponding eigenvectors are the same as those for A. (See Exercises 15 and
16.)
Suppose, for example, that is closer to 2than to the other eigenvalues of A.
Then 1=. 2 /will be a strictly dominant eigenvalue of B. Ifis really close to 2,
then1=. 2 /ismuch larger than the other eigenvalues of B, and the inverse power
method produces a very rapid approximation to 2for almost all choices of x0. The
following algorithm gives the details.

Notice that B, or rather .A I/ 1, does not appear in the algorithm. Instead of
computing .A I/ 1xkto get the next vector in the sequence, it is better to solve
the equation .A I/ykDxkforyk(and then scale ykto produce xkC1/. Since this
equation for ykmust be solved for each k, an LU factorization of A Iwill speed up
the process.
EXAMPLE 3 It is not uncommon in some applications to need to know the smallest
eigenvalue of a matrix Aand to have at hand rough estimates of the eigenvalues.

If an estimate for the smallest eigenvalue of a matrix is not available, one can simply
takeD0in the inverse power method. This choice of works reasonably well if the
smallest eigenvalue is much closer to zero than to the other eigenvalues.

326 CHAPTER 5 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
The two algorithms presented in this section are practical tools for many simple
situations, and they provide an introduction to the problem of eigenvalue estimation. A
more robust and widely used iterative method is the QR algorithm. For instance, it is
the heart of the MATLAB command eig(A) , which rapidly computes eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of A. A brief description of the QR algorithm was given in the exercises
for Section 5.2. Further details are presented in most modern numerical analysis texts.

6Orthogonality and
Least Squares
INTRODUCTORY EXAMPLE
The North American Datum
and GPS Navigation
Imagine starting a massive project that you estimate will
take ten years and require the efforts of scores of people
to construct and solve a 1,800,000-by-900,000 system
of linear equations. That is exactly what the National
Geodetic Survey did in 1974, when it set out to update
the North American Datum (NAD)—a network of 268,000
precisely located reference points that span the entire North
American continent, together with Greenland, Hawaii, the
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean islands.
The recorded latitudes and longitudes in the NAD
must be determined to within a few centimeters because
they form the basis for all surveys, maps, legal property
boundaries, and layouts of civil engineering projects
such as highways and public utility lines. However,
more than 200,000 new points had been added to the
datum since the last adjustment in 1927, and errors had
gradually accumulated over the years, due to imprecise
measurements and shifts in the earth’s crust. Data gathering
for the NAD readjustment was completed in 1983.
The system of equations for the NAD had no solution
in the ordinary sense, but rather had a least-squares
solution , which assigned latitudes and longitudes to the
reference points in a way that corresponded best to the
1.8 million observations. The least-squares solution was
found in 1986 by solving a related system of so-callednormal equations , which involved 928,735 equations in
928,735 variables.1
More recently, knowledge of reference points on the
ground has become crucial for accurately determining
the locations of satellites in the satellite-based Global
Positioning System (GPS) . A GPS satellite calculates its
position relative to the earth by measuring the time it takes
for signals to arrive from three ground transmitters. To do
this, the satellites use precise atomic clocks that have been
synchronized with ground stations (whose locations are
known accurately because of the NAD).
The Global Positioning System is used both for
determining the locations of new reference points on the
ground and for ﬁnding a user’s position on the ground
relative to established maps. When a car driver (or a
mountain climber) turns on a GPS receiver, the receiver
measures the relative arrival times of signals from at
least three satellites. This information, together with the
transmitted data about the satellites’ locations and message
times, is used to adjust the GPS receiver’s time and to
determine its approximate location on the earth. Given
information from a fourth satellite, the GPS receiver can
even establish its approximate altitude.
1A mathematical discussion of the solution strategy (along with details
of the entire NAD project) appears in North American Datum of 1983 ,

and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Professional Paper NOS 2,

332 CHAPTER 6 Orthogonality and Least Squares
Both the NAD and GPS problems are solved by ﬁnding
a vector that “approximately satisﬁes” an inconsistent
system of equations. A careful explanation of this apparentcontradiction will require ideas developed in the ﬁrst ﬁve
sections of this chapter.
WEB
In order to ﬁnd an approximate solution to an inconsistent system of equations that has
no actual solution, a well-deﬁned notion of nearness is needed. Section 6.1 introduces
the concepts of distance and orthogonality in a vector space. Sections 6.2 and 6.3 show
how orthogonality can be used to identify the point within a subspace Wthat is nearest
to a point ylying outside of W. By taking Wto be the column space of a matrix,
Section 6.5 develops a method for producing approximate (“least-squares”) solutions
for inconsistent linear systems, such as the system solved for the NAD report.
Section 6.4 provides another opportunity to see orthogonal projections at work,
creating a matrix factorization widely used in numerical linear algebra. The remaining
sections examine some of the many least-squares problems that arise in applications,
including those in vector spaces more general than Rn.
6.1 INNER PRODUCT, LENGTH, AND ORTHOGONALITY
Geometric concepts of length, distance, and perpendicularity, which are well known for
R2andR3, are deﬁned here for Rn. These concepts provide powerful geometric tools for
solving many applied problems, including the least-squares problems mentioned above.
All three notions are deﬁned in terms of the inner product of two vectors.
The Inner Product
Ifuandvare vectors in Rn, then we regard uandvasn1matrices. The transpose
uTis a1nmatrix, and the matrix product uTvis a11matrix, which we write as
a single real number (a scalar) without brackets. The number uTvis called the inner
product ofuandv, and often it is written as uv. This inner product, mentioned in the
exercises for Section 2.1, is also referred to as a dot product . If

Interpretation of kvkas length.plane, as usual, then kvkcoincides with the standard notion of the length of the line
segment from the origin to v. This follows from the Pythagorean Theorem applied to a
triangle such as the one in Figure 1.
A similar calculation with the diagonal of a rectangular box shows that the deﬁnition
of length of a vector vinR3coincides with the usual notion of length.
For any scalar c, the length of cvisjcjtimes the length of v. That is,

A vector whose length is 1 is called a unit vector . If we divide a nonzero vector v
by its length—that is, multiply by 1=kvk—we obtain a unit vector ubecause the length
ofuis.1=kvk/kvk. The process of creating ufrom vis sometimes called normalizing
v, and we say that uisin the same direction asv.
Several examples that follow use the space-saving notation for (column) vectors.

Distance in Rn
We are ready now to describe how close one vector is to another. Recall that if aand
bare real numbers, the distance on the number line between aandbis the number
ja bj. Two examples are shown in Figure 3. This deﬁnition of distance in Rhas a
direct analogue in Rn.
|2 – 8| = |–6| = 6   or   |8 – 2| = |6| = 6 |(–3) – 4| = |–7| = 7   or   |4 – (–3)| = |7| = 76 units aparta b a b

D E F I N I T I O N ForuandvinRn, the distance between u and v , written as dist .u;v/, is the
length of the vector u v. That is,
dist.u;v/D ku vk
InR2andR3, this deﬁnition of distance coincides with the usual formulas for the
Euclidean distance between two points, as the next two examples show.

The two squared distances are equal if and only if 2uvD  2uv, which happens if and
only if uvD0.
This calculation shows that when vectors uandvare identiﬁed with geometric
points, the corresponding lines through the points and the origin are perpendicular if
and only if uvD0. The following deﬁnition generalizes to Rnthis notion of perpen-
dicularity (or orthogonality , as it is commonly called in linear algebra).
D E F I N I T I O N Two vectors uandvinRnareorthogonal (to each other) if uvD0.
Observe that the zero vector is orthogonal to every vector in Rnbecause 0TvD0
for all v.
The next theorem provides a useful fact about orthogonal vectors. The proof follows
immediately from the calculation in (1) above and the deﬁnition of orthogonality. The
right triangle shown in Figure 6 provides a visualization of the lengths that appear in
the theorem.
T H E O R E M 2 The Pythagorean Theorem
Two vectors uandvare orthogonal if and only if kuCvk2D kuk2C kvk2.
Orthogonal Complements
To provide practice using inner products, we introduce a concept here that will be of use
in Section 6.3 and elsewhere in the chapter. If a vector zis orthogonal to every vector
in a subspace WofRn, then zis said to be orthogonal to W. The set of all vectors z
that are orthogonal to Wis called the orthogonal complement ofWand is denoted by
W?(and read as “ Wperpendicular” or simply “ Wperp”).

||u + v|| u||v||

A plane and line through 0as
orthogonal complements.is inW, then the line segment from 0tozis perpendicular to the line segment from 0to
w; that is, zwD0. See Figure 7. So each vector on Lis orthogonal to every winW.
In fact, Lconsists of allvectors that are orthogonal to the w’s inW, and Wconsists of
all vectors orthogonal to the z’s inL. That is,
LDW?and WDL?
The following two facts about W?, with Wa subspace of Rn, are needed later
in the chapter. Proofs are suggested in Exercises 29 and 30. Exercises 27–31 provide
excellent practice using properties of the inner product.
1.A vector xis inW?if and only if xis orthogonal to every vector in a set that
spans W.
2.W?is a subspace of Rn.
The next theorem and Exercise 31 verify the claims made in Section 4.6 concerning
the subspaces shown in Figure 8. (Also see Exercise 28 in Section 4.6.)

Remark: A common way to prove that two sets, say SandT, are equal is to show
thatSis a subset of TandTis a subset of S. The proof of the next theorem that
NulAD(Row A)?is established by showing that Nul Ais a subset of (Row A)?and
(Row A)?is a subset of Nul A. That is, an arbitrary element xin Nul Ais shown to be in
(Row A)?, and then an arbitrary element xin (Row A)?is shown to be in Nul A.

the null space of A, and the orthogonal complement of the column space of Ais
the null space of AT:
.RowA/?DNulAand .ColA/?DNulAT
PROOF The row–column rule for computing Axshows that if xis in Nul A, then xis
orthogonal to each row of A(with the rows treated as vectors in Rn/. Since the rows
ofAspan the row space, xis orthogonal to Row A. Conversely, if xis orthogonal to
RowA, then xis certainly orthogonal to each row of A, and hence AxD0. This proves
the ﬁrst statement of the theorem. Since this statement is true for any matrix, it is true
forAT. That is, the orthogonal complement of the row space of ATis the null space of
AT. This proves the second statement, because Row ATDColA.
Angles in R2andR3(Optional)
Ifuandvare nonzero vectors in either R2orR3, then there is a nice connection between
their inner product and the angle #between the two line segments from the origin to the
points identiﬁed with uandv. The formula is
uvD kuk kvkcos# (2)
To verify this formula for vectors in R2, consider the triangle shown in Figure 9, with
sides of lengths kuk,kvk, andku vk. By the law of cosines,

Since the line segment in Figure 3 between yandOyis perpendicular to L, by con-
struction of Oy, the point identiﬁed with Oyis the closest point of Ltoy. (This can be proved
from geometry. We will assume this for R2now and prove it for Rnin Section 6.3.)

A Geometric Interpretation of Theorem 5
The formula for the orthogonal projection Oyin (2) has the same appearance as each of the
terms in Theorem 5. Thus Theorem 5 decomposes a vector yinto a sum of orthogonal
projections onto one-dimensional subspaces.
It is easy to visualize the case in which WDR2DSpanfu1;u2g, with u1andu2
orthogonal. Any yinR2can be written in the form
yDyu1
u1u1u1Cyu2
u2u2u2 (3)
The ﬁrst term in (3) is the projection of yonto the subspace spanned by u1(the line
through u1and the origin), and the second term is the projection of yonto the subspace
spanned by u2. Thus (3) expresses yas the sum of its projections onto the (orthogonal)
axes determined by u1andu2. See Figure 4.

Decomposing a Force into Component Forces
The decomposition in Figure 4 can occur in physics when some sort of force is applied to
an object. Choosing an appropriate coordinate system allows the force to be represented
by a vector yinR2orR3. Often the problem involves some particular direction of
interest, which is represented by another vector u. For instance, if the object is moving
in a straight line when the force is applied, the vector umight point in the direction of
movement, as in Figure 5. A key step in the problem is to decompose the force into
a component in the direction of uand a component orthogonal to u. The calculations
would be analogous to those made in Example 3 above.

Orthonormal Sets
A set fu1; : : : ; upgis an orthonormal set if it is an orthogonal set of unit vectors. If W
is the subspace spanned by such a set, then fu1; : : : ; upgis an orthonormal basis for
W, since the set is automatically linearly independent, by Theorem 4.
The simplest example of an orthonormal set is the standard basis fe1; : : : ; engfor
Rn. Any nonempty subset of fe1; : : : ; engis orthonormal, too. Here is a more compli-
cated example.

6.2 Orthogonal Sets 345
When the vectors in an orthogonal set of nonzero vectors are normalized to have
unit length, the new vectors will still be orthogonal, and hence the new set will be
an orthonormal set. See Exercise 32. It is easy to check that the vectors in Figure 6
(Example 5) are simply the unit vectors in the directions of the vectors in Figure 1
(Example 1).
Matrices whose columns form an orthonormal set are important in applications and
in computer algorithms for matrix computations. Their main properties are given in
Theorems 6 and 7.
T H E O R E M 6 Anmnmatrix Uhas orthonormal columns if and only if UTUDI.
PROOF To simplify notation, we suppose that Uhas only three columns, each a vector
inRm. The proof of the general case is essentially the same. Let UDu1u2u3

The entries in the matrix at the right are inner products, using transpose notation. The
columns of Uare orthogonal if and only if

2u1D0; uT
1u3DuT

The columns of Uall have unit length if and only if
uT
1u1D1; uT
2u2D1; uT

The theorem follows immediately from (4)–(6).

thogonality. These properties are crucial for many computer algorithms. See Exercise 25

Theorems 6 and 7 are particularly useful when applied to square matrices. An
orthogonal matrix is a square invertible matrix Usuch that U 1DUT. By Theo-
rem 6, such a matrix has orthonormal columns.1It is easy to see that any square matrix
with orthonormal columns is an orthogonal matrix. Surprisingly, such a matrix must
have orthonormal rows , too. See Exercises 27 and 28. Orthogonal matrices will appear
frequently in Chapter 7.

6.3 ORTHOGONAL PROJECTIONS
The orthogonal projection of a point in R2onto a line through the origin has an important
analogue in Rn. Given a vector yand a subspace WinRn, there is a vector OyinWsuch
that (1) Oyis the unique vector in Wfor which y Oyis orthogonal to W, and (2) Oyis
the unique vector in Wclosest to y. See Figure 1. These two properties of Oyprovide the
key to ﬁnding least-squares solutions of linear systems, mentioned in the introductory
example for this chapter. The full story will be told in Section 6.5.
To prepare for the ﬁrst theorem, observe that whenever a vector yis written as a
linear combination of vectors u1; : : : ; uninRn, the terms in the sum for ycan be grouped

the rest of the ui. This idea is particularly useful when fu1; : : : ; ungis an orthogonal
basis. Recall from Section 6.1 that W?denotes the set of all vectors orthogonal to a
subspace W.

because u1is orthogonal to u3,u4, and u5. A similar calculation shows that z2u2D0.
Thus z2is inW?.
The next theorem shows that the decomposition yDz1Cz2in Example 1 can be
computed without having an orthogonal basis for Rn. It is enough to have an orthogonal

T H E O R E M 8 The Orthogonal Decomposition Theorem
LetWbe a subspace of Rn. Then each yinRncan be written uniquely in the form
yDOyCz (1)
where Oyis inWandzis inW?. In fact, if fu1; : : : ; upgis any orthogonal basis of
W, then

andzDy Oy.
The vector Oyin (1) is called the orthogonal projection of y onto Wand often is
written as projWy. See Figure 2. When Wis a one-dimensional subspace, the formula
forOymatches the formula given in Section 6.2.

FIGURE 2 The orthogonal projection
ofyontoW.
PROOF Letfu1; : : : ; upgbe any orthogonal basis for W, and deﬁne Oyby (2).1Then Oy
is inWbecause Oyis a linear combination of the basis u1; : : : ; up. Let zDy Oy. Since
u1is orthogonal to u2; : : : ; up, it follows from (2) that
zu1D.y Oy/u1Dyu1 yu1
u1u1
u1u1 0       0
Dyu1 yu1D0
Thus zis orthogonal to u1. Similarly, zis orthogonal to each ujin the basis for W.
Hence zis orthogonal to every vector in W. That is, zis inW?.
To show that the decomposition in (1) is unique, suppose ycan also be written as
yDOy1Cz1, with Oy1inWandz1inW?. Then OyCzDOy1Cz1(since both sides equal
y/, and so
Oy Oy1Dz1 z
This equality shows that the vector vDOy Oy1is inWand in W?(because z1andz
are both in W?, and W?is a subspace). Hence vvD0, which shows that vD0. This
proves that OyDOy1and also z1Dz.
The uniqueness of the decomposition (1) shows that the orthogonal projection Oy
depends only on Wand not on the particular basis used in (2).
1We may assume that Wis not the zero subspace, for otherwise W?DRnand (1) is simply yD0Cy.
The next section will show that any nonzero subspace of Rnhas an orthogonal basis.

A Geometric Interpretation of the Orthogonal Projection
When Wis a one-dimensional subspace, the formula (2) for projWycontains just one
term. Thus, when dim W > 1 , each term in (2) is itself an orthogonal projection of y
onto a one-dimensional subspace spanned by one of the u’s in the basis for W. Figure 3
illustrates this when Wis a subspace of R3spanned by u1andu2. Here Oy1andOy2denote
the projections of yonto the lines spanned by u1andu2, respectively. The orthogonal
projection OyofyontoWis the sum of the projections of yonto one-dimensional sub-
spaces that are orthogonal to each other. The vector Oyin Figure 3 corresponds to the
vector yin Figure 4 of Section 6.2, because now it is Oythat is in W.

Properties of Orthogonal Projections
Iffu1; : : : ; upgis an orthogonal basis for Wand if yhappens to be in W, then the
formula for projWyis exactly the same as the representation of ygiven in Theorem 5
in Section 6.2. In this case, projWyDy.
Ifyis inWDSpanfu1; : : : ; upg, then projWyDy.
This fact also follows from the next theorem.
T H E O R E M 9 The Best Approximation Theorem
LetWbe a subspace of Rn, letybe any vector in Rn, and let Oybe the orthogonal
projection of yontoW. Then Oyis the closest point in Wtoy, in the sense that
ky Oyk<ky vk (3)
for all vinWdistinct from Oy.
The vector Oyin Theorem 9 is called the best approximation to y by elements of W.
Later sections in the text will examine problems where a given ymust be replaced, or
approximated , by a vector vin some ﬁxed subspace W. The distance from ytov, given
byky vk, can be regarded as the “error” of using vin place of y. Theorem 9 says that
this error is minimized when vDOy.
Inequality (3) leads to a new proof that Oydoes not depend on the particular orthogo-
nal basis used to compute it. If a different orthogonal basis for Wwere used to construct
an orthogonal projection of y, then this projection would also be the closest point in W
toy, namely, Oy.
PROOF Take vinWdistinct from Oy. See Figure 4. Then Oy vis inW. By the Orthogo-
nal Decomposition Theorem, y Oyis orthogonal to W. In particular, y Oyis orthogonal
toOy v(which is in W). Since
y vD.y Oy/C.Oy v/
the Pythagorean Theorem gives
ky vk2D ky Oyk2C kOy vk2
(See the colored right triangle in Figure 4. The length of each side is labeled.) Now
kOy vk2> 0because Oy v¤0, and so inequality (3) follows immediately.

The ﬁnal theorem in this section shows how formula (2) for projWyis simpliﬁed

PROOF Formula (4) follows immediately from (2) in Theorem 8. Also, (4) shows
that projWyis a linear combination of the columns of Uusing the weights yu1,
yu2; : : : ; yup. The weights can be written as uT
1y;uT

IfUis an nn(square) matrix with orthonormal columns, then Uis an orthogonal

Although formula (4) is important for theoretical purposes, in practice it usually
involves calculations with square roots of numbers (in the entries of the ui/. Formula
(2) is recommended for hand calculations.

By the Orthogonal Decomposition Theorem, vkC1is orthogonal to Wk. Note that

WkC1is a subspace and is closed under subtraction). Furthermore, vkC1¤0because

An orthonormal basis is constructed easily from an orthogonal basis fv1; : : : ; vpg:
simply normalize (i.e., “scale”) all the vk. When working problems by hand, this is
easier than normalizing each vkas soon as it is found (because it avoids unnecessary

QR Factorization of Matrices
If an mnmatrix Ahas linearly independent columns x1; : : : ; xn, then applying the

Gram–Schmidt process (with normalizations) to x1; : : : ; xnamounts to factoring A, as
described in the next theorem. This factorization is widely used in computer algorithms
for various computations, such as solving equations (discussed in Section 6.5) and
ﬁnding eigenvalues (mentioned in the exercises for Section 5.2).

N U M E R I C A L N O T E S
1.When the Gram–Schmidt process is run on a computer, roundoff error can
build up as the vectors ukare calculated, one by one. For jandklarge but
unequal, the inner products uT
jukmay not be sufﬁciently close to zero. This
loss of orthogonality can be reduced substantially by rearranging the order
of the calculations.1However, a different computer-based QR factorization is
usually preferred to this modiﬁed Gram–Schmidt method because it yields a
more accurate orthonormal basis, even though the factorization requires about
twice as much arithmetic.
2.To produce a QR factorization of a matrix A, a computer program usually
left-multiplies Aby a sequence of orthogonal matrices until Ais transformed
into an upper triangular matrix. This construction is analogous to the left-
multiplication by elementary matrices that produces an LU factorization of A.

6.5 LEAST-SQUARES PROBLEMS
The chapter’s introductory example described a massive problem AxDbthat had no
solution. Inconsistent systems arise often in applications, though usually not with such
an enormous coefﬁcient matrix. When a solution is demanded and none exists, the best
one can do is to ﬁnd an xthat makes Axas close as possible to b.
Think of Axas an approximation tob. The smaller the distance between bandAx,
given by kb Axk, the better the approximation. The general least-squares problem
is to ﬁnd an xthat makes kb Axkas small as possible. The adjective “least-squares”
arises from the fact that kb Axkis the square root of a sum of squares.
D E F I N I T I O N IfAismnandbis inRm, aleast-squares solution ofAxDbis an OxinRn
such that
kb AOxk  k b Axk
for all xinRn.
The most important aspect of the least-squares problem is that no matter what xwe
select, the vector Axwill necessarily be in the column space, Col A. So we seek an x
that makes Axthe closest point in Col Atob. See Figure 1. (Of course, if bhappens to
be in Col A, then bisAxfor some x, and such an xis a “least-squares solution.”)
Solution of the General Least-Squares Problem
Given Aandbas above, apply the Best Approximation Theorem in Section 6.3 to the
subspace Col A. Let

the columns of A. See Figure 2. [There are many solutions of (1) if the equation has free

364 CHAPTER 6 Orthogonality and Least Squares
PROOF As shown above, the set of least-squares solutions is nonempty and each
least-squares solution Oxsatisﬁes the normal equations. Conversely, suppose Oxsatisﬁes
ATAOxDATb. Then Oxsatisﬁes (2) above, which shows that b AOxis orthogonal to the
rows of ATand hence is orthogonal to the columns of A. Since the columns of Aspan
ColA, the vector b AOxis orthogonal to all of Col A. Hence the equation
bDAOxC.b AOx/
is a decomposition of binto the sum of a vector in Col Aand a vector orthogonal to
ColA. By the uniqueness of the orthogonal decomposition, AOxmust be the orthogonal
projection of bonto Col A. That is, AOxDOb, and Oxis a least-squares solution.

The next theorem gives useful criteria for determining when there is only one least-
squares solution of AxDb. (Of course, the orthogonal projection Obis always unique.)
T H E O R E M 1 4 LetAbe an mnmatrix. The following statements are logically equivalent:
a.The equation AxDbhas a unique least-squares solution for each binRm.
b.The columns of Aare linearly independent.
c.The matrix ATAis invertible.
When these statements are true, the least-squares solution Oxis given by
OxD.ATA/ 1ATb (4)
The main elements of a proof of Theorem 14 are outlined in Exercises 19–21, which
also review concepts from Chapter 4. Formula (4) for Oxis useful mainly for theoretical
purposes and for hand calculations when ATAis a22invertible matrix.
When a least-squares solution Oxis used to produce AOxas an approximation to b,
the distance from btoAOxis called the least-squares error of this approximation.
EXAMPLE 3 Given Aandbas in Example 1, determine the least-squares error in
the least-squares solution of AxDb.

In some cases, the normal equations for a least-squares problem can be ill-
conditioned ; that is, small errors in the calculations of the entries of ATAcan sometimes
cause relatively large errors in the solution Ox. If the columns of Aare linearly inde-
pendent, the least-squares solution can often be computed more reliably through a QR
factorization of A(described in Section 6.4).1
1The QR method is compared with the standard normal equation method in G. Golub and C. Van Loan,
Matrix Computations , 3rd ed. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1996), pp. 230–231.

T H E O R E M 1 5 Given an mnmatrix Awith linearly independent columns, let ADQRbe a
QR factorization of Aas in Theorem 12. Then, for each binRm, the equation
AxDbhas a unique least-squares solution, given by
OxDR 1QTb (6)
PROOF LetOxDR 1QTb. Then
AOxDQROxDQRR 1QTbDQQTb
By Theorem 12, the columns of Qform an orthonormal basis for Col A. Hence, by
Theorem 10, QQTbis the orthogonal projection Obofbonto Col A. Then AOxDOb, which
shows that Oxis a least-squares solution of AxDb. The uniqueness of Oxfollows from
Theorem 14.

Since Rin Theorem 15 is upper triangular, Oxshould be calculated as the exact
solution of the equation

It is much faster to solve (7) by back-substitution or row operations than to
compute R 1and use (6).

6.6 APPLICATIONS TO LINEAR MODELS
A common task in science and engineering is to analyze and understand relationships
among several quantities that vary. This section describes a variety of situations in which
data are used to build or verify a formula that predicts the value of one variable as a
function of other variables. In each case, the problem will amount to solving a least-
squares problem.
For easy application of the discussion to real problems that you may encounter later
in your career, we choose notation that is commonly used in the statistical analysis of
scientiﬁc and engineering data. Instead of AxDb, we write XDyand refer to Xas
thedesign matrix ,as the parameter vector , and yas the observation vector .
Least-Squares Lines
The simplest relation between two variables xand yis the linear equation
yD0C1x.1Experimental data often produce points .x1; y1/; : : : ; .x n; yn/that,

6.6 Applications to Linear Models 371
when graphed, seem to lie close to a line. We want to determine the parameters 0
and1that make the line as “close” to the points as possible.
Suppose 0and1are ﬁxed, and consider the line yD0C1xin Figure 1.
Corresponding to each data point .xj; yj/there is a point .xj; 0C1xj/on the line
with the same x-coordinate. We call yjtheobserved value of yand0C1xjthe
predicted y-value (determined by the line). The difference between an observed y-value
and a predicted y-value is called a residual .
ResidualResidualPoint on lineData pointy
xjx1xnxy = /H92520 + /H92521x(xj, /H92520 + /H92521xj)(xj, yj)
FIGURE 1 Fitting a line to experimental data.
There are several ways to measure how “close” the line is to the data. The usual
choice (primarily because the mathematical calculations are simple) is to add the squares
of the residuals. The least-squares line is the line yD0C1xthat minimizes the
sum of the squares of the residuals. This line is also called a line of regression of y
on x, because any errors in the data are assumed to be only in the y-coordinates. The
coefﬁcients 0,1of the line are called (linear) regression coefﬁcients .2
If the data points were on the line, the parameters 0and1would satisfy the
equations

Of course, if the data points don’t lie on a line, then there are no parameters 0,1for
which the predicted y-values in Xequal the observed y-values in y, and XDyhas
no solution. This is a least-squares problem, AxDb, with different notation!
The square of the distance between the vectors Xandyis precisely the sum of
the squares of the residuals. The that minimizes this sum also minimizes the distance
between Xandy.Computing the least-squares solution of XDyis equivalent to
ﬁnding the that determines the least-squares line in Figure 1 .
2If the measurement errors are in xinstead of y, simply interchange the coordinates of the data .xj; yj/
before plotting the points and computing the regression line. If both coordinates are subject to possible error,
then you might choose the line that minimizes the sum of the squares of the orthogonal (perpendicular)
distances from the points to the line. See the Practice Problems for Section 7.5.

A common practice before computing a least-squares line is to compute the average
xof the original x-values and form a new variable xDx x. The new x-data are said
to be in mean-deviation form . In this case, the two columns of the design matrix will
be orthogonal. Solution of the normal equations is simpliﬁed, just as in Example 4 in
Section 6.5. See Exercises 17 and 18.

6.6 Applications to Linear Models 373
The General Linear Model
In some applications, it is necessary to ﬁt data points with something other than a straight
line. In the examples that follow, the matrix equation is still XDy, but the speciﬁc
form of Xchanges from one problem to the next. Statisticians usually introduce a
residual vector , deﬁned by Dy X, and write
yDXC
Any equation of this form is referred to as a linear model . Once Xandyare determined,
the goal is to minimize the length of , which amounts to ﬁnding a least-squares solution
ofXDy. In each case, the least-squares solution Ois a solution of the normal
equations
XTXDXTy
Least-Squares Fitting of Other Curves
When data points .x1; y1/; : : : ; .x n; yn/on a scatter plot do not lie close to any line, it
may be appropriate to postulate some other functional relationship between xandy.
The next two examples show how to ﬁt data by curves that have the general form
yD0f0.x/C1f1.x/C    C kfk.x/ (2)
where f0; : : : ; f kare known functions and 0; : : : ;  kare parameters that must be
determined. As we will see, equation (2) describes a linear model because it is linear in
the unknown parameters.
For a particular value of x, (2) gives a predicted, or “ﬁtted,” value of y. The
difference between the observed value and the predicted value is the residual. The
parameters 0; : : : ;  kmust be determined so as to minimize the sum of the squares
of the residuals.
EXAMPLE 2 Suppose data points .x1; y1/; : : : ; .x n; yn/appear to lie along some
sort of parabola instead of a straight line. For instance, if the x-coordinate denotes the
production level for a company, and ydenotes the average cost per unit of operating at
a level of xunits per day, then a typical average cost curve looks like a parabola that
opens upward (Figure 3). In ecology, a parabolic curve that opens downward is used

Multiple Regression
Suppose an experiment involves two independent variables—say, uandv—and one
dependent variable, y. A simple equation for predicting yfrom uandvhas the form
yD0C1uC2v (4)
A more general prediction equation might have the form
yD0C1uC2vC3u2C4uvC5v2(5)
This equation is used in geology, for instance, to model erosion surfaces, glacial cirques,
soil pH, and other quantities. In such cases, the least-squares ﬁt is called a trend surface .
Equations (4) and (5) both lead to a linear model because they are linear in the
unknown parameters (even though uandvare multiplied). In general, a linear model
will arise whenever yis to be predicted by an equation of the form
yD0f0.u; v/ C1f1.u; v/ C    C kfk.u; v/
withf0; : : : ; f kany sort of known functions and 0; : : : ;  kunknown weights.
EXAMPLE 4 In geography, local models of terrain are constructed from data
.u1; v1; y1/; : : : ; .u n; vn; yn/, where uj,vj, and yjare latitude, longitude, and altitude,
respectively. Describe the linear model based on (4) that gives a least-squares ﬁt to such
data. The solution is called the least-squares plane . See Figure 6.

Example 4 shows that the linear model for multiple regression has the same abstract
form as the model for the simple regression in the earlier examples. Linear algebra gives
us the power to understand the general principle behind all the linear models. Once X
is deﬁned properly, the normal equations for have the same matrix form, no matter
how many variables are involved. Thus, for any linear model where XTXis invertible,
the least-squares Ois given by .XTX/ 1XTy.

PRACTICE PROBLEM
When the monthly sales of a product are subject to seasonal ﬂuctuations, a curve that
approximates the sales data might have the form
yD0C1xC2sin.2x=12/
where xis the time in months. The term 0C1xgives the basic sales trend, and the
sine term reﬂects the seasonal changes in sales. Give the design matrix and the parameter
vector for the linear model that leads to a least-squares ﬁt of the equation above. Assume
the data are .x1; y1/; : : : ; .x n; yn/.

Every statistics text that discusses regression and the linear model

378 CHAPTER 6 Orthogonality and Least Squares
6.7 INNER PRODUCT SPACES
Notions of length, distance, and orthogonality are often important in applications
involving a vector space. For Rn, these concepts were based on the properties of the
inner product listed in Theorem 1 of Section 6.1. For other spaces, we need analogues of
the inner product with the same properties. The conclusions of Theorem 1 now become
axioms in the following deﬁnition.

A vector space with an inner product is called an inner product space .
The vector space Rnwith the standard inner product is an inner product space, and
nearly everything discussed in this chapter for Rncarries over to inner product spaces.
The examples in this section and the next lay the foundation for a variety of applications
treated in courses in engineering, physics, mathematics, and statistics.
EXAMPLE 1 Fix any two positive numbers—say, 4 and 5—and for vectors
uD.u1; u2/andvD.v1; v2/inR2, set
hu;vi D4u1v1C5u2v2 (1)
Show that equation (1) deﬁnes an inner product.
SOLUTION Certainly Axiom 1 is satisﬁed, because hu;vi D4u1v1C5u2v2D

This veriﬁes Axiom 2. For Axiom 3, compute
hcu;vi D4.cu 1/v1C5.cu 2/v2Dc.4u 1v1C5u2v2/Dchu;vi
For Axiom 4, note that hu;ui D4u2

0, that is, if uD0. Also, h0;0i D0. So (1) deﬁnes an inner product on R2.
Inner products similar to (1) can be deﬁned on Rn. They arise naturally in con-
nection with “weighted least-squares” problems, in which weights are assigned to the
various entries in the sum for the inner product in such a way that more importance is
given to the more reliable measurements.
From now on, when an inner product space involves polynomials or other functions,
we will write the functions in the familiar way, rather than use the boldface type for
vectors. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that each function isa vector when it
is treated as an element of a vector space.

The Gram–Schmidt Process
The existence of orthogonal bases for ﬁnite-dimensional subspaces of an inner product
space can be established by the Gram–Schmidt process, just as in Rn. Certain orthogonal
bases that arise frequently in applications can be constructed by this process.
The orthogonal projection of a vector onto a subspace Wwith an orthogonal basis
can be constructed as usual. The projection does not depend on the choice of orthogonal
basis, and it has the properties described in the Orthogonal Decomposition Theorem and
the Best Approximation Theorem.

Best Approximation in Inner Product Spaces
A common problem in applied mathematics involves a vector space Vwhose elements
are functions. The problem is to approximate a function finVby a function gfrom a
speciﬁed subspace WofV. The “closeness” of the approximation of fdepends on the
waykf gkis deﬁned. We will consider only the case in which the distance between
fandgis determined by an inner product. In this case, the best approximation to fby
functions in Wis the orthogonal projection of fonto the subspace W.

andp2be the orthogonal basis found in Example 5 for the subspace P2. Find the best
approximation to p.t/D5 1

1Each polynomial in P4is uniquely determined by its value at the ﬁve numbers  2; : : : ; 2 . In fact, the
correspondence between pand its vector of values is an isomorphism, that is, a one-to-one mapping onto
R5that preserves linear combinations.

An Inner Product for C a; b (Calculus required)
Probably the most widely used inner product space for applications is the vector space
C a; b of all continuous functions on an interval atb, with an inner product that
we will describe.
We begin by considering a polynomial pand any integer nlarger than or equal
to the degree of p. Then pis inPn, and we may compute a “length” for pusing the
inner product of Example 2 involving evaluation at nC1points in a; b . However, this
length of pcaptures the behavior at only those nC1points. Since pis inPnfor all
large n, we could use a much larger n, with many more points for the “evaluation” inner
product. See Figure 4.

The function f .t/2is continuous and nonnegative on a; b . If the deﬁnite integral of

6.8 APPLICATIONS OF INNER PRODUCT SPACES
The examples in this section suggest how the inner product spaces deﬁned in Section 6.7
arise in practical problems. The ﬁrst example is connected with the massive least-
squares problem of updating the North American Datum, described in the chapter’s
introductory example.
Weighted Least-Squares
Letybe a vector of nobservations, y1; : : : ; y n, and suppose we wish to approximate yby
a vector Oythat belongs to some speciﬁed subspace of Rn. (In Section 6.5, Oywas written
asAxso that Oywas in the column space of A.) Denote the entries in OybyOy1; : : : ; Oyn.
Then the sum of the squares for error , or SS(E), in approximating ybyOyis
SS(E) D.y1  Oy1/2C    C .yn  Oyn/2(1)
This is simply ky Oyk2, using the standard length in Rn.
SECOND REVISED PAGES


--- Page 403 ---
386 CHAPTER 6 Orthogonality and Least Squares
Now suppose the measurements that produced the entries in yare not equally
reliable. (This was the case for the North American Datum, since measurements were
made over a period of 140 years.) As another example, the entries in ymight be
computed from various samples of measurements, with unequal sample sizes.) Then
it becomes appropriate to weight the squared errors in (1) in such a way that more
importance is assigned to the more reliable measurements.1If the weights are denoted
byw2
1; : : : ; w2
n, then the weighted sum of the squares for error is
Weighted SS(E) Dw2
1.y1  Oy1/2C    C w2
n.yn  Oyn/2(2)
This is the square of the length of y Oy, where the length is derived from an inner
product analogous to that in Example 1 in Section 6.7, namely,
hx;yi Dw2
1x1y1C    C w2

It is sometimes convenient to transform a weighted least-squares problem into an
equivalent ordinary least-squares problem. Let Wbe the diagonal matrix with (positive)
w1; : : : ; w non its diagonal, so that

with a similar expression for WOy. Observe that the jth term in (2) can be written as
w2
j.yj  Oyj/2D.wjyj wjOyj/2
It follows that the weighted SS(E) in (2) is the square of the ordinary length in Rnof
Wy WOy, which we write as kWy WOyk2.
Now suppose the approximating vector Oyis to be constructed from the columns of
a matrix A. Then we seek an Oxthat makes AOxDOyas close to yas possible. However,
the measure of closeness is the weighted error,
kWy WOyk2D kWy WAOxk2
Thus Oxis the (ordinary) least-squares solution of the equation
WAxDWy
The normal equation for the least-squares solution is
.WA/TWAxD.WA/TWy
EXAMPLE 1 Find the least-squares line yD0C1xthat best ﬁts the data

of the last two data points are greater than for the other points. Weight these data half as
much as the rest of the data.

Trend Analysis of Data
Letfrepresent an unknown function whose values are known (perhaps only approx-
imately) at t0; : : : ; t n. If there is a “linear trend” in the data f .t0/; : : : ; f .t n/, then we
might expect to approximate the values of fby a function of the form 0C1t.
If there is a “quadratic trend” to the data, then we would try a function of the form
0C1tC2t2. This was discussed in Section 6.6, from a different point of view.
In some statistical problems, it is important to be able to separate the linear trend
from the quadratic trend (and possibly cubic or higher-order trends). For instance,
suppose engineers are analyzing the performance of a new car, and f .t/ represents
the distance between the car at time tand some reference point. If the car is traveling
at constant velocity, then the graph of f .t/ should be a straight line whose slope is the
car’s velocity. If the gas pedal is suddenly pressed to the ﬂoor, the graph of f .t/ will
change to include a quadratic term and possibly a cubic term (due to the acceleration).
To analyze the ability of the car to pass another car, for example, engineers may want
to separate the quadratic and cubic components from the linear term.
If the function is approximated by a curve of the form yD0C1tC2t2, the
coefﬁcient 2may not give the desired information about the quadratic trend in the data,
because it may not be “independent” in a statistical sense from the other i. To make

what is known as a trend analysis of the data, we introduce an inner product on the
spacePnanalogous to that given in Example 2 in Section 6.7. For p,qinPn, deﬁne
hp; qi Dp.t0/q.t 0/C    C p.tn/q.t n/
In practice, statisticians seldom need to consider trends in data of degree higher than
cubic or quartic. So let p0,p1,p2,p3denote an orthogonal basis of the subspace P3of
Pn, obtained by applying the Gram–Schmidt process to the polynomials 1, t,t2, and t3.
By Supplementary Exercise 11 in Chapter 2, there is a polynomial ginPnwhose values
att0; : : : ; t ncoincide with those of the unknown function f. Let Ogbe the orthogonal
projection (with respect to the given inner product) of gontoP3, say,
OgDc0p0Cc1p1Cc2p2Cc3p3
Then Ogis called a cubic trend function , and c0; : : : ; c 3are the trend coefﬁcients of
the data. The coefﬁcient c1measures the linear trend, c2the quadratic trend, and c3the
cubic trend. It turns out that if the data have certain properties, these coefﬁcients are
statistically independent.
Since p0; : : : ; p 3are orthogonal, the trend coefﬁcients may be computed one
at a time, independently of one another. (Recall that ciD hg; p ii=hpi; pii.) We can
ignore p3andc3if we want only the quadratic trend. And if, for example, we needed
to determine the quartic trend, we would have to ﬁnd (via Gram–Schmidt) only a
polynomial p4inP4that is orthogonal to P3and compute hg; p 4i=hp4; p4i.
EXAMPLE 2 The simplest and most common use of trend analysis occurs when the
points t0; : : : ; t ncan be adjusted so that they are evenly spaced and sum to zero. Fit a
quadratic trend function to the data . 2; 3/,. 1; 5/,.0; 5/ ,.1; 4/ , and .2; 3/ .

found in Example 5 of Section 6.7:

The calculations involve only these vectors, not the speciﬁc formulas for the orthogonal
polynomials. The best approximation to the data by polynomials in P2is the orthogonal
projection given by

Since the coefﬁcient of p2is not extremely small, it would be reasonable to conclude
that the trend is at least quadratic. This is conﬁrmed by the graph in Figure 2.

Fourier Series (Calculus required)
Continuous functions are often approximated by linear combinations of sine and cosine
functions. For instance, a continuous function might represent a sound wave, an electric
signal of some type, or the movement of a vibrating mechanical system.
For simplicity, we consider functions on 0t2. It turns out that any function

for a sufﬁciently large value of n. The function (4) is called a trigonometric poly-
nomial . Ifanandbnare not both zero, the polynomial is said to be of order n. The
connection between trigonometric polynomials and other functions in C 0; 2 depends
on the fact that for any n1, the set

The norm of the difference between fand a Fourier approximation is called the
mean square error in the approximation. (The term mean refers to the fact that the norm
is determined by an integral.) It can be shown that the mean square error approaches
zero as the order of the Fourier approximation increases. For this reason, it is common
to write

This expression for f .t/ is called the Fourier series forfon0; 2 . The term
amcosmt, for example, is the projection of fonto the one-dimensional subspace
spanned by cos mt.

INTRODUCTORY EXAMPLE
Multichannel Image Processing
Around the world in little more than 80 minutes , the two
Landsat satellites streak silently across the sky in near
polar orbits, recording images of terrain and coastline, in
swaths 185 kilometers wide. Every 16 days, each satellite
passes over almost every square kilometer of the earth’s
surface, so any location can be monitored every 8 days.
The Landsat images are useful for many purposes.
Developers and urban planners use them to study the rate
and direction of urban growth, industrial development, and
other changes in land usage. Rural countries can analyze
soil moisture, classify the vegetation in remote regions, and
locate inland lakes and streams. Governments can detect
and assess damage from natural disasters, such as forest
ﬁres, lava ﬂows, ﬂoods, and hurricanes. Environmental
agencies can identify pollution from smokestacks and
measure water temperatures in lakes and rivers near power
plants.
Sensors aboard the satellite acquire seven simul-
taneous images of any region on earth to be studied. The
sensors record energy from separate wavelength bands—
three in the visible light spectrum and four in infrared and
thermal bands. Each image is digitized and stored as a
rectangular array of numbers, each number indicating the
signal intensity at a corresponding small point (or pixel )on the image. Each of the seven images is one channel of
amultichannel ormultispectral image .
The seven Landsat images of one ﬁxed region typically
contain much redundant information, since some features
will appear in several images. Yet other features, because of
their color or temperature, may reﬂect light that is recorded
by only one or two sensors. One goal of multichannel
image processing is to view the data in a way that extracts
information better than studying each image separately.
Principal component analysis is an effective way
to suppress redundant information and provide in only
one or two composite images most of the information
from the initial data. Roughly speaking, the goal is to
ﬁnd a special linear combination of the images, that is,
a list of weights that at each pixel combine all seven
corresponding image values into one new value. The
weights are chosen in a way that makes the range of light
intensities—the scene variance —in the composite image
(called the ﬁrst principal component ) greater than that in
any of the original images. Additional component images
can also be constructed, by criteria that will be explained
in Section 7.5.

396 CHAPTER 7 Symmetric Matrices and Quadratic Forms
Principal component analysis is illustrated in the
photos below, taken over Railroad Valley, Nevada. Images
from three Landsat spectral bands are shown in (a)–(c).
The total information in the three bands is rearranged
in the three principal component images in (d)–(f). The
ﬁrst component (d) displays (or “explains”) 93.5% of the
scene variance present in the initial data. In this way, the
three-channel initial data have been reduced to one-channel
data, with a loss in some sense of only 6.5% of the scene
variance.
Earth Satellite Corporation of Rockville, Maryland,
which kindly supplied the photos shown here, is
experimenting with images from 224 separate spectral
bands. Principal component analysis, essential for such
massive data sets, typically reduces the data to about 15
usable principal components.

Symmetric matrices arise more often in applications, in one way or another, than any
other major class of matrices. The theory is rich and beautiful, depending in an essential
way on both diagonalization from Chapter 5 and orthogonality from Chapter 6. The
diagonalization of a symmetric matrix, described in Section 7.1, is the foundation for
the discussion in Sections 7.2 and 7.3 concerning quadratic forms. Section 7.3, in turn, is
needed for the ﬁnal two sections on the singular value decomposition and on the image
processing described in the introductory example. Throughout the chapter, all vectors
and matrices have real entries.

7.1Diagonalization of Symmetric Matrices 397
7.1 DIAGONALIZATION OF SYMMETRIC MATRICES
Asymmetric matrix is a matrix Asuch that AT=A. Such a matrix is necessarily square.
Its main diagonal entries are arbitrary, but its other entries occur in pairs—on opposite
sides of the main diagonal.
EXAMPLE 1 Of the following matrices, only the ﬁrst three are symmetric:

process of Section 5.3.

These three vectors form a basis for R3. In fact, it is easy to check that fv1;v2;v3gis an
orthogonal basis for R3. Experience from Chapter 6 suggests that an orthonormal basis
might be useful for calculations, so here are the normalized (unit) eigenvectors.

Then ADPDP 1, as usual. But this time, since Pis square and has orthonormal
columns, Pis an orthogonal matrix, and P 1is simply PT. (See Section 6.2.)
Theorem 1 explains why the eigenvectors in Example 2 are orthogonal—they cor-
respond to distinct eigenvalues.

orthogonal.

The special type of diagonalization in Example 2 is crucial for the theory of sym-
metric matrices. An nnmatrix Ais said to be orthogonally diagonalizable if there
are an orthogonal matrix P(with P 1DPT) and a diagonal matrix Dsuch that
ADPDPTDPDP 1(1)
Such a diagonalization requires nlinearly independent and orthonormal eigenvec-
tors. When is this possible? If Ais orthogonally diagonalizable as in (1), then
ATD.PDPT/TDPT TDTPTDPDPTDA
Thus Ais symmetric! Theorem 2 below shows that, conversely, every symmetric matrix
is orthogonally diagonalizable. The proof is much harder and is omitted; the main idea
for a proof will be given after Theorem 3.
T H E O R E M 2 Annnmatrix Ais orthogonally diagonalizable if and only if Ais a symmetric
matrix.
This theorem is rather amazing, because the work in Chapter 5 would suggest that
it is usually impossible to tell when a matrix is diagonalizable. But this is not the case
for symmetric matrices.
The next example treats a matrix whose eigenvalues are not all distinct.

Then fv1;z2gis an orthogonal set in the eigenspace for D7. (Note that z2is a linear
combination of the eigenvectors v1andv2, soz2is in the eigenspace. This construction
ofz2is just the Gram–Schmidt process of Section 6.4.) Since the eigenspace is two-
dimensional (with basis v1;v2/, the orthogonal set fv1;z2gis an orthogonal basis for
the eigenspace, by the Basis Theorem. (See Section 2.9 or 4.5.)

Then Porthogonally diagonalizes A, and ADPDP 1.
In Example 3, the eigenvalue 7 has multiplicity two and the eigenspace is two-
dimensional. This fact is not accidental, as the next theorem shows.
The Spectral Theorem
The set of eigenvalues of a matrix Ais sometimes called the spectrum ofA, and the
following description of the eigenvalues is called a spectral theorem.
T H E O R E M 3 The Spectral Theorem for Symmetric Matrices
Annnsymmetric matrix Ahas the following properties:
a.Ahasnreal eigenvalues, counting multiplicities.
b.The dimension of the eigenspace for each eigenvalue equals the multiplicity
ofas a root of the characteristic equation.
c.The eigenspaces are mutually orthogonal, in the sense that eigenvectors cor-
responding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.
d.Ais orthogonally diagonalizable.
Part (a) follows from Exercise 24 in Section 5.5. Part (b) follows easily from part
(d). (See Exercise 31.) Part (c) is Theorem 1. Because of (a), a proof of (d) can be given
using Exercise 32 and the Schur factorization discussed in Supplementary Exercise 16
in Chapter 6. The details are omitted.

7.1Diagonalization of Symmetric Matrices 401
N U M E R I C A L N O T E
When Ais symmetric and not too large, modern high-performance computer al-
gorithms calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors with great precision. They apply
a sequence of similarity transformations to Ainvolving orthogonal matrices. The
diagonal entries of the transformed matrices converge rapidly to the eigenvalues
ofA. (See the Numerical Notes in Section 5.2.) Using orthogonal matrices gener-
ally prevents numerical errors from accumulating during the process. When Ais
symmetric, the sequence of orthogonal matrices combines to form an orthogonal
matrix whose columns are eigenvectors of A.
A nonsymmetric matrix cannot have a full set of orthogonal eigenvectors, but
the algorithm still produces fairly accurate eigenvalues. After that, nonorthogonal
techniques are needed to calculate eigenvectors.

7.2Quadratic Forms 403
7.2 QUADRATIC FORMS
Until now, our attention in this text has focused on linear equations, except for the sums
of squares encountered in Chapter 6 when computing xTx. Such sums and more general
expressions, called quadratic forms , occur frequently in applications of linear algebra
to engineering (in design criteria and optimization) and signal processing (as output
noise power). They also arise, for example, in physics (as potential and kinetic energy),
differential geometry (as normal curvature of surfaces), economics (as utility functions),
and statistics (in conﬁdence ellipsoids). Some of the mathematical background for such
applications ﬂows easily from our work on symmetric matrices.
Aquadratic form onRnis a function Qdeﬁned on Rnwhose value at a vector x

In some cases, quadratic forms are easier to use when they have no cross-product
terms—that is, when the matrix of the quadratic form is a diagonal matrix. Fortunately,
the cross-product term can be eliminated by making a suitable change of variable.
Change of Variable in a Quadratic Form
Ifxrepresents a variable vector in Rn, then a change of variable is an equation of the
form
xDPy; or equivalently ;yDP 1x (1)
where Pis an invertible matrix and yis a new variable vector in Rn. Here yis the
coordinate vector of xrelative to the basis of Rndetermined by the columns of P. (See
Section 4.4.)
If the change of variable (1) is made in a quadratic form xTAx, then
xTAxD.Py/TA.P y/DyTPTAPyDyT.PTAP / y (2)
and the new matrix of the quadratic form is PTAP. Since Ais symmetric, Theorem 2
guarantees that there is an orthogonal matrix Psuch that PTAPis a diagonal matrix D,
and the quadratic form in (2) becomes yTDy. This is the strategy of the next example.
EXAMPLE 4 Make a change of variable that transforms the quadratic form in Ex-
ample 3 into a quadratic form with no cross-product term.
SOLUTION The matrix of the quadratic form in Example 3 is

T H E O R E M 4 The Principal Axes Theorem
LetAbe an nnsymmetric matrix. Then there is an orthogonal change of
variable, xDPy, that transforms the quadratic form xTAxinto a quadratic form
yTDywith no cross-product term.
The columns of Pin the theorem are called the principal axes of the quadratic
form xTAx. The vector yis the coordinate vector of xrelative to the orthonormal basis
ofRngiven by these principal axes.

semideﬁnite ifQ.x/0for all x. The quadratic forms in parts (a) and (b) of Figure 4

The classiﬁcation of a quadratic form is often carried over to the matrix of the form.
Thus a positive deﬁnite matrix Ais asymmetric matrix for which the quadratic form
xTAxis positive deﬁnite. Other terms, such as positive semideﬁnite matrix , are deﬁned
analogously.

A fast way to determine whether a symmetric matrix Ais positive deﬁnite is
to attempt to factor Ain the form ADRTR, where Ris upper triangular with
positive diagonal entries. (A slightly modiﬁed algorithm for an LU factorization
is one approach.) Such a Cholesky factorization is possible if and only if Ais
positive deﬁnite. See Supplementary Exercise 7 at the end of Chapter 7.

7.3 CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION
Engineers, economists, scientists, and mathematicians often need to ﬁnd the maximum
or minimum value of a quadratic form Q.x/forxin some speciﬁed set. Typically, the
problem can be arranged so that xvaries over the set of unit vectors. This constrained
optimization problem has an interesting and elegant solution. Example 6 below and the
discussion in Section 7.5 will illustrate how such problems arise in practice.
The requirement that a vector xinRnbe a unit vector can be stated in several
equivalent ways:
kxk D1; kxk2D1; xTxD1
and
x2
1Cx2
2C    C x2
nD1 (1)
The expanded version (1) of xTxD1is commonly used in applications.
When a quadratic form Qhas no cross-product terms, it is easy to ﬁnd the maximum
and minimum of Q.x/forxTxD1.
EXAMPLE 1 Find the maximum and minimum values of Q.x/D9x2

xis a unit vector. Furthermore, Q.x/D9when xD.1; 0; 0/ . Thus 9 is the maximum
value of Q.x/forxTxD1.
To ﬁnd the minimum value of Q.x/, observe that

7.3Constrained Optimization 411
It is easy to see in Example 1 that the matrix of the quadratic form Qhas eigen-
values 9, 4, and 3 and that the greatest and least eigenvalues equal, respectively, the
(constrained) maximum and minimum of Q.x/. The same holds true for any quadratic
form, as we shall see.

the intersection of the cylinder with the surface is the set of points .x1; x2; ´/such
that´DQ.x 1; x2/andx2

2D1. The “heights” of these points are the constrained
values of Q.x/. Geometrically, the constrained optimization problem is to locate the
highest and lowest points on the intersection curve.
The two highest points on the curve are 7 units above the x1x2-plane, occurring
where x1D0andx2D 1. These points correspond to the eigenvalue 7 of Aand
the eigenvectors xD.0; 1/ and xD.0; 1/. Similarly, the two lowest points on the
curve are 3 units above the x1x2-plane. They correspond to the eigenvalue 3 and the
eigenvectors .1; 0/ and. 1; 0/.

It can be shown that for any symmetric matrix A, the set of all possible values of
xTAx, forkxk D1, is a closed interval on the real axis. (See Exercise 13.) Denote the
left and right endpoints of this interval by mandM, respectively. That is, let
mDminfxTAxW kxk D1g; M DmaxfxTAxW kxk D1g (2)
Exercise 12 asks you to prove that if is an eigenvalue of A, then mM. The
next theorem says that mandMare themselves eigenvalues of A, just as in Example 2.1
1The use of minimum andmaximum in (2), and least andgreatest in the theorem, refers to the natural
ordering of the real numbers, not to magnitudes.

In Theorem 7 and in later applications, the values of xTAxare computed with addi-

T H E O R E M 7 LetA;  1, and u1be as in Theorem 6. Then the maximum value of xTAxsubject
to the constraints
xTxD1; xTu1D0
is the second greatest eigenvalue, 2, and this maximum is attained when xis an
eigenvector u2corresponding to 2.
Theorem 7 can be proved by an argument similar to the one above in which the
theorem is reduced to the case where the matrix of the quadratic form is diagonal. The
next example gives an idea of the proof for the case of a diagonal matrix.

Thus the constrained maximum of the quadratic form does not exceed 4. And this value
is attained for xD.0; 1; 0/ , which is an eigenvector for the second greatest eigenvalue
of the matrix of the quadratic form.

The vector u2is automatically orthogonal to u1because the vectors correspond to dif-

attained when xDu2.

useful characterization of allthe eigenvalues of A. The proof is omitted.

EXAMPLE 6 During the next year, a county government is planning to repair x
hundred miles of public roads and bridges and to improve yhundred acres of parks and
recreation areas. The county must decide how to allocate its resources (funds, equip-
ment, labor, etc.) between these two projects. If it is more cost effective to work si-
multaneously on both projects rather than on only one, then xandymight satisfy a
constraint such as
4x2C9y236
See Figure 3. Each point .x; y/ in the shaded feasible set represents a possible public
works schedule for the year. The points on the constraint curve, 4x2C9y2D36, use

In choosing its public works schedule, the county wants to consider the opinions of
the county residents. To measure the value, or utility , that the residents would assign to
the various work schedules .x; y/ , economists sometimes use a function such as
q.x; y/ Dxy
The set of points .x; y/ at which q.x; y/ is a constant is called an indifference curve .
Three such curves are shown in Figure 4. Points along an indifference curve correspond
to alternatives that county residents as a group would ﬁnd equally valuable.2Find the
public works schedule that maximizes the utility function q.

7.4 THE SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION
The diagonalization theorems in Sections 5.3 and 7.1 play a part in many interesting ap-
plications. Unfortunately, as we know, not all matrices can be factored as ADPDP 1
with Ddiagonal. However, a factorization ADQDP 1ispossible for any mn
matrix A! A special factorization of this type, called the singular value decomposition ,
is one of the most useful matrix factorizations in applied linear algebra.
The singular value decomposition is based on the following property of the ordinary
diagonalization that can be imitated for rectangular matrices: The absolute values of the
eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix Ameasure the amounts that Astretches or shrinks

Thesingular values ofAare the square roots of the eigenvalues of ATA, denoted by

By equation (2), the singular values of A are the lengths of the vectors Av1; : : : ; A vn.

In some cases, the rank of Amay be very sensitive to small changes in the entries
ofA. The obvious method of counting the number of pivot columns in Adoes
not work well if Ais row reduced by a computer. Roundoff error often creates an
echelon form with full rank.
In practice, the most reliable way to estimate the rank of a large matrix A
is to count the number of nonzero singular values. In this case, extremely small
nonzero singular values are assumed to be zero for all practical purposes, and the
effective rank of the matrix is the number obtained by counting the remaining
nonzero singular values.1

The next two examples focus attention on the internal structure of a singular value
decomposition. An efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithm for this decomposition
would use a different approach. See the Numerical Note at the end of the section.

SG Computing an SVD
7–10 ATAand a corresponding orthonormal set of eigenvectors. If Ahad only two columns,
the calculations could be done by hand. Larger matrices usually require a matrix pro-
gram.2However, for the matrix Ahere, the eigendata for ATAare provided in Example 1.
Step 2 .Set up V and .Arrange the eigenvalues of ATAin decreasing order. In Ex-
ample 1, the eigenvalues are already listed in decreasing order: 360, 90, and 0. The
corresponding unit eigenvectors, v1,v2, and v3, are the right singular vectors of A. Using

Applications of the Singular Value Decomposition
The SVD is often used to estimate the rank of a matrix, as noted above. Several other nu-
merical applications are described brieﬂy below, and an application to image processing
is presented in Section 7.5.
EXAMPLE 5 (The Condition Number) Most numerical calculations involving an
equation AxDbare as reliable as possible when the SVD of Ais used. The two
orthogonal matrices UandVdo not affect lengths of vectors or angles between vectors
(Theorem 7 in Section 6.2). Any possible instabilities in numerical calculations are
identiﬁed in . If the singular values of Aare extremely large or small, roundoff errors
are almost inevitable, but an error analysis is aided by knowing the entries in andV.
IfAis an invertible nnmatrix, then the ratio 1=nof the largest and smallest
singular values gives the condition number ofA. Exercises 41–43 in Section 2.3
showed how the condition number affects the sensitivity of a solution of AxDbto
changes (or errors) in the entries of A. (Actually, a “condition number” of Acan be
computed in several ways, but the deﬁnition given here is widely used for studying
AxDb.)

matrix A, letu1; : : : ; umbe the left singular vectors, v1; : : : ; vnthe right singular vectors,

Recall from Theorem 3 in Section 6.1 that .ColA/?DNulAT. Hence

Since kAvik Difor1in, and iis 0 if and only if i > r , the vectors

has the smallest length among all least-squares solutions of AxDb. See Supplementary
Exercise 14.
N U M E R I C A L N O T E
Examples 1–4 and the exercises illustrate the concept of singular values and
suggest how to perform calculations by hand. In practice, the computation of ATA
should be avoided, since any errors in the entries of Aare squared in the entries
ofATA. There exist fast iterative methods that produce the singular values and
singular vectors of Aaccurately to many decimal places.

7.5 APPLICATIONS TO IMAGE PROCESSING AND STATISTICS
The satellite photographs in this chapter’s introduction provide an example of multidi-
mensional, or multivariate , data—information organized so that each datum in the data
set is identiﬁed with a point (vector) in Rn. The main goal of this section is to explain a
technique, called principal component analysis , used to analyze such multivariate data.
The calculations will illustrate the use of orthogonal diagonalization and the singular
value decomposition.
SECOND REVISED PAGES


--- Page 444 ---
7.5Applications to Image Processing and Statistics 427
Principal component analysis can be applied to any data that consist of lists of
measurements made on a collection of objects or individuals. For instance, consider a
chemical process that produces a plastic material. To monitor the process, 300 samples
are taken of the material produced, and each sample is subjected to a battery of eight
tests, such as melting point, density, ductility, tensile strength, and so on. The laboratory
report for each sample is a vector in R8, and the set of such vectors forms an 8300
matrix, called the matrix of observations .
Loosely speaking, we can say that the process control data are eight-dimensional.
The next two examples describe data that can be visualized graphically.
EXAMPLE 1 An example of two-dimensional data is given by a set of weights and
heights of Ncollege students. Let Xjdenote the observation vector inR2that lists the
weight and height of the jth student. If wdenotes weight and hheight, then the matrix
of observations has the formw1w2   wN
h1h2   hN
66 6
X1 X2 XN
The set of observation vectors can be visualized as a two-dimensional scatter plot . See
Figure 1.

w
FIGURE 1 A scatter plot of observation
vectors X1; : : : ; XN.
EXAMPLE 2 The ﬁrst three photographs of Railroad Valley, Nevada, shown in the
chapter introduction can be viewed as oneimage of the region, with three spectral
components , because simultaneous measurements of the region were made at three
separate wavelengths. Each photograph gives different information about the same
physical region. For instance, the ﬁrst pixel in the upper-left corner of each photograph
corresponds to the same place on the ground (about 30 meters by 30 meters). To each
pixel there corresponds an observation vector in R3that lists the signal intensities for
that pixel in the three spectral bands.
Typically, the image is 20002000 pixels, so there are 4 million pixels in the
image. The data for the image form a matrix with 3 rows and 4 million columns
(with columns arranged in any convenient order). In this case, the “multidimensional”
character of the data refers to the three spectral dimensions rather than the two spatial
dimensions that naturally belong to any photograph. The data can be visualized as a
cluster of 4 million points in R3, perhaps as in Figure 2.

To discuss the entries in SDsij, let Xrepresent a vector that varies over the
set of observation vectors and denote the coordinates of Xbyx1; : : : ; x p. Then x1,
for example, is a scalar that varies over the set of ﬁrst coordinates of X1; : : : ; XN. For
jD1; : : : ; p , the diagonal entry sjjinSis called the variance ofxj.
The variance of xjmeasures the spread of the values of xj. (See Exercise 13.) In
Example 3, the variance of x1is 10 and the variance of x3is 32. The fact that 32 is more
than 10 indicates that the set of third entries in the response vectors contains a wider
spread of values than the set of ﬁrst entries.
Thetotal variance of the data is the sum of the variances on the diagonal of S. In
general, the sum of the diagonal entries of a square matrix Sis called the trace of the
matrix, written tr .S/. Thus
ftotal variance g Dtr.S/
The entry sijinSfori¤jis called the covariance ofxiandxj. Observe that
in Example 3, the covariance between x1andx3is 0 because the .1; 3/ -entry in Sis 0.
Statisticians say that x1andx3areuncorrelated . Analysis of the multivariate data in
X1; : : : ; XNis greatly simpliﬁed when most or all of the variables x1; : : : ; x pare uncor-
related, that is, when the covariance matrix of X1; : : : ; XNis diagonal or nearly diagonal.
Principal Component Analysis
For simplicity, assume that the matrix X1   XNis already in mean-deviation
form. The goal of principal component analysis is to ﬁnd an orthogonal ppmatrix
PDu1   upthat determines a change of variable, XDPY, or

with the property that the new variables y1; : : : ; y pare uncorrelated and are arranged in
order of decreasing variance.
The orthogonal change of variable XDPYmeans that each observation vector Xk
receives a “new name,” Yk, such that XkDPYk. Notice that Ykis the coordinate vector
ofXkwith respect to the columns of P, and YkDP 1XkDPTXkforkD1; : : : ; N .
It is not difﬁcult to verify that for any orthogonal P, the covariance matrix of
Y1; : : : ; YNisPTSP(Exercise 11). So the desired orthogonal matrix Pis one that
makes PTSPdiagonal. Let Dbe a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues 1; : : : ;  p
ofSon the diagonal, arranged so that 12     p0, and let Pbe an
orthogonal matrix whose columns are the corresponding unit eigenvectors u1; : : : ; up.
Then SDPDPTandPTSPDD.
The unit eigenvectors u1; : : : ; upof the covariance matrix Sare called the principal
components of the data (in the matrix of observations). The ﬁrst principal component
is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of S, the second principal
component is the eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue, and so on.
The ﬁrst principal component u1determines the new variable y1in the following
way. Let c1; : : : ; c pbe the entries in u1. Since uT
1is the ﬁrst row of PT, the equation
YDPTXshows that
y1DuT
1XDc1x1Cc2x2C    C cpxp
Thus y1is a linear combination of the original variables x1; : : : ; x p, using the entries in
the eigenvector u1as weights. In a similar fashion, u2determines the variable y2, and
so on.

Using two decimal places for simplicity, the variable for the ﬁrst principal component is
y1D:54x 1C:63x 2C:56x 3
This equation was used to create photograph (d) in the chapter introduction. The
variables x1,x2, and x3are the signal intensities in the three spectral bands. The values
ofx1, converted to a gray scale between black and white, produced photograph (a).
Similarly, the values of x2andx3produced photographs (b) and (c), respectively. At
each pixel in photograph (d), the gray scale value is computed from y1, a weighted
linear combination of x1; x2;andx3. In this sense, photograph (d) “displays” the ﬁrst
principal component of the data.
In Example 4, the covariance matrix for the transformed data, using variables y1,
y2, and y3, is
DD2

Although Dis obviously simpler than the original covariance matrix S, the merit
of constructing the new variables is not yet apparent. However, the variances of the
variables y1,y2, and y3appear on the diagonal of D, and obviously the ﬁrst variance
inDis much larger than the other two. As we shall see, this fact will permit us to view
the data as essentially one-dimensional rather than three-dimensional.
Reducing the Dimension of Multivariate Data
Principal component analysis is potentially valuable for applications in which most of
the variation, or dynamic range, in the data is due to variations in only a few of the new
variables, y1; : : : ; y p.
It can be shown that an orthogonal change of variables, XDPY, does not change
the total variance of the data. (Roughly speaking, this is true because left-multiplication
byPdoes not change the lengths of vectors or the angles between them. See Exercise
12.) This means that if SDPDPT, thentotal variance

SOLUTION The total variance of the data is
tr.D/D7614:23 C427:63 C98:10 D8139:96
[Verify that this number also equals tr .S/.] The percentages of the total variance

8139:96D93:5%427:63
8139:96D5:3%98:10

In a sense, 93.5% of the information collected by Landsat for the Railroad Valley region
is displayed in photograph (d), with 5.3% in (e) and only 1.2% remaining for (f).
The calculations in Example 5 show that the data have practically no variance in
the third (new) coordinate. The values of y3are all close to zero. Geometrically, the
data points lie nearly in the plane y3D0, and their locations can be determined fairly
accurately by knowing only the values of y1andy2. In fact, y2also has relatively small
variance, which means that the points lie approximately along a line, and the data are
essentially one-dimensional. See Figure 2, in which the data resemble a popsicle stick.
Characterizations of Principal Component Variables
Ify1; : : : ; y parise from a principal component analysis of a pNmatrix of obser-
vations, then the variance of y1is as large as possible in the following sense: If uis
any unit vector and if yDuTX, then the variance of the values of yasXvaries over
the original data X1; : : : ; XNturns out to be uTSu. By Theorem 8 in Section 7.3, the
maximum value of uTSu, over all unit vectors u, is the largest eigenvalue 1ofS, and
this variance is attained when uis the corresponding eigenvector u1. In the same way,
Theorem 8 shows that y2has maximum possible variance among all variables yDuTX
that are uncorrelated withy1. Likewise, y3has maximum possible variance among all
variables uncorrelated with both y1andy2, and so on.

and more accurate than an eigenvalue decomposition of S. This is particularly
true, for instance, in the hyperspectral image processing (with pD224) men-
tioned in the chapter introduction. Principal component analysis is completed in
seconds on specialized workstations.

8The Geometry of
Vector Spaces
INTRODUCTORY EXAMPLE
The Platonic Solids
In the city of Athens in 387 B.C., the Greek philosopher
Plato founded an Academy, sometimes referred to as the
world’s ﬁrst university. While the curriculum included
astronomy, biology, political theory, and philosophy, the
subject closest to his heart was geometry. Indeed, inscribed
over the doors of his academy were these words: “Let no
one destitute of geometry enter my doors.”
The Greeks were greatly impressed by geometric
patterns such as the regular solids. A polyhedron is called
regular if its faces are congruent regular polygons and all
the angles at the vertices are equal. As early as 100 years
before Plato, the Pythagoreans knew at least three of the
regular solids: the tetrahedron (4 triangular faces), the cube
(6 square faces), and the octahedron (8 triangular faces).
(See Figure 1.) These shapes occur naturally as crystals of
common minerals. There are only ﬁve such regular solids,
the remaining two being the dodecahedron (12 pentagonal
faces) and the icosahedron (20 triangular faces).
Plato discussed the basic theory of these ﬁve solids in
the dialogue Timaeus , and since then they have carried his
name: the Platonic solids.
For centuries there was no need to envision geometric
objects in more than three dimensions. But nowadays
mathematicians regularly deal with objects in vector spaceshaving four, ﬁve, or even hundreds of dimensions. It is not
necessarily clear what geometrical properties one might
ascribe to these objects in higher dimensions.
For example, what properties do lines have in
2-space and planes have in 3-space that would be useful
in higher dimensions? How can one characterize such
objects? Sections 8.1 and 8.4 provide some answers.
The hyperplanes of Section 8.4 will be important for
understanding the multidimensional nature of the linear
programming problems in Chapter 9.
What would the analogue of a polyhedron “look
like” in more than three dimensions? A partial answer
is provided by two-dimensional projections of the four-
dimensional object, created in a manner analogous to two-
dimensional projections of a three-dimensional object.
Section 8.5 illustrates this idea for the four-dimensional
“cube” and the four-dimensional “simplex.”
The study of geometry in higher dimensions not
only provides new ways of visualizing abstract algebraic
concepts, but also creates tools that may be applied in R3.
For instance, Sections 8.2 and 8.6 include applications to
computer graphics, and Section 8.5 outlines a proof (in
Exercise 22) that there are only ﬁve regular polyhedra in
R3.

438 CHAPTER 8 The Geometry of Vector Spaces
FIGURE 1 The ﬁve Platonic solids.
Most applications in earlier chapters involved algebraic calculations with subspaces and
linear combinations of vectors. This chapter studies sets of vectors that can be visualized
as geometric objects such as line segments, polygons, and solid objects. Individual
vectors are viewed as points. The concepts introduced here are used in computer graph-
ics, linear programming (in Chapter 9), and other areas of mathematics.1
Throughout the chapter, sets of vectors are described by linear combinations, but
with various restrictions on the weights used in the combinations. For instance, in Sec-
tion 8.1, the sum of the weights is 1, while in Section 8.2, the weights are positive and
sum to 1. The visualizations are in R2orR3, of course, but the concepts also apply to
Rnand other vector spaces.
8.1 AFFINE COMBINATIONS
An afﬁne combination of vectors is a special kind of linear combination. Given vec-
tors (or “points”) v1;v2; : : : ; vpinRnand scalars c1; : : : ; c p, anafﬁne combination of
v1;v2; : : : ; vpis a linear combination

(Boston: Addison-Wesley, 1996), pp. 1083–1112. That material also discusses coordinate-free “afﬁne
spaces.”

D E F I N I T I O N The set of all afﬁne combinations of points in a set Sis called the afﬁne hull (or
afﬁne span ) ofS, denoted by aff S.
The afﬁne hull of a single point v1is just the set fv1g, since it has the form c1v1where
c1D1. The afﬁne hull of two distinct points is often written in a special way. Suppose
yDc1v1Cc2v2withc1Cc2D1. Write tin place of c2, so that c1D1 c2D1 t.
Then the afﬁne hull of fv1;v2gis the set
yD.1 t/v1Ctv2;withtinR (1)
This set of points includes v1(when tD0) and v2(when tD1). Ifv2Dv1, then (1)
again describes just one point. Otherwise, (1) describes the linethrough v1andv2. To
see this, rewrite (1) in the form
yDv1Ct.v2 v1/DpCtu;withtinR
where pisv1anduisv2 v1. The set of all multiples of uis Span fug, the line through
uand the origin. Adding pto each point on this line translates Span fuginto the line
through pparallel to the line through uand the origin. See Figure 1. (Compare this

Geometrically, a set is afﬁne if whenever two points are in the set, the entire line
through these points is in the set. (If Scontains only one point, p, then the line through
pandpis just a point, a “degenerate” line.) Algebraically, for a set Sto be afﬁne,
the deﬁnition requires that every afﬁne combination of two points of Sbelong to S.
Remarkably, this is equivalent to requiring that Scontain every afﬁne combination of
an arbitrary number of points of S.
T H E O R E M 2 A set Sis afﬁne if and only if every afﬁne combination of points of Slies in S.
That is, Sis afﬁne if and only if SDaffS.
Remark: See the remark prior to Theorem 5 in Chapter 3 regarding mathematical indu-
ction.
PROOF Suppose that Sis afﬁne and use induction on the number mof points of S
occurring in an afﬁne combination. When mis 1 or 2, an afﬁne combination of mpoints
ofSlies in S, by the deﬁnition of an afﬁne set. Now, assume that every afﬁne combina-
tion of kor fewer points of Syields a point in S, and consider a combination of kC1
points. Take viinSforiD1; : : : ; k C1, and let yDc1v1C  C ckvkCckC1vkC1,
where c1C  C ckC1D1. Since the ci’s sum to 1, at least one of them must not be
equal to 1. By reindexing the viandci, if necessary, we may assume that ckC1¤1. Let

CckC1vkC1 (6)
By the induction hypothesis, the point zD.c1=t/v1C  C .ck=t/vkis inS, since the
coefﬁcients sum to 1. Thus (6) displays yas an afﬁne combination of two points in S,
and so y2S. By the principle of induction, every afﬁne combination of such points
lies in S. That is, aff SS. But the reverse inclusion, SaffS, always applies. Thus,
when Sis afﬁne, SDaffS. Conversely, if SDaffS, then afﬁne combinations of two
(or more) points of Slie in S, soSis afﬁne.

442 CHAPTER 8 The Geometry of Vector Spaces
The next deﬁnition provides terminology for afﬁne sets that emphasizes their close
connection with subspaces of Rn.
D E F I N I T I O N A translate of a set SinRnby a vector pis the set SCpD fsCpWs2Sg.2Aﬂat
inRnis a translate of a subspace of Rn. Two ﬂats are parallel if one is a translate of
the other. The dimension of a ﬂat is the dimension of the corresponding parallel
subspace. The dimension of a set S, written as dim S, is the dimension of the
smallest ﬂat containing S. AlineinRnis a ﬂat of dimension 1. A hyperplane in
Rnis a ﬂat of dimension n 1.
InR3, the proper subspaces3consist of the origin 0, the set of all lines through 0, and
the set of all planes through 0. Thus the proper ﬂats in R3are points (zero-dimensional),
lines (one-dimensional), and planes (two-dimensional), which may or may not pass
through the origin.
The next theorem shows that these geometric descriptions of lines and planes in R3
(as translates of subspaces) actually coincide with their earlier algebraic descriptions as
sets of all afﬁne combinations of two or three points, respectively.
T H E O R E M 3 A nonempty set Sis afﬁne if and only if it is a ﬂat.
Remark: Notice the key role that deﬁnitions play in this proof. For example, the ﬁrst
part assumes that Sis afﬁne and seeks to show that Sis a ﬂat. By deﬁnition, a ﬂat is a
translate of a subspace. By choosing pinSand deﬁning WDSC. p/, the set Sis
translated to the origin and SDWCp. It remains to show that Wis a subspace, for
thenSwill be a translate of a subspace and hence a ﬂat.
PROOF Suppose that Sis afﬁne. Let pbe any ﬁxed point in Sand let WDSC. p/,
so that SDWCp. To show that Sis a ﬂat, it sufﬁces to show that Wis a subspace of
Rn. Since pis inS, the zero vector is in W. To show that Wis closed under sums and
scalar multiples, it sufﬁces to show that if u1andu2are elements of W, then u1Ctu2
is inWfor every real t. Since u1andu2are in W, there exist s1ands2inSsuch that
u1Ds1 pandu2Ds2 p. So, for each real t,
u1Ctu2D.s1 p/Ct.s2 p/
D.1 t/s1Ct.s1Cs2 p/ p
LetyDs1Cs2 p. Then yis an afﬁne combination of points in S. Since Sis afﬁne, yis
inS(by Theorem 2). But then .1 t/s1Ctyis also in S. Sou1Ctu2is in pCSDW.
This shows that Wis a subspace of Rn. Thus Sis a ﬂat, because SDWCp.
Conversely, suppose Sis a ﬂat. That is, SDWCpfor some p2Rnand some
subspace W. To show that Sis afﬁne, it sufﬁces to show that for any pair s1ands2of
points in S, the line through s1ands2lies in S. By deﬁnition of W, there exist u1and
u2inWsuch that s1Du1Cpands2Du2Cp. So, for each real t,
.1 t/s1Cts2D.1 t/.u1Cp/Ct.u2Cp/
D.1 t/u1Ctu2Cp
Since Wis a subspace, .1 t/u1Ctu22Wand so .1 t/s1Cts22WCpDS.
Thus Sis afﬁne.
2IfpD0, then the translate is just Sitself. See Figure 4 in Section 1.5.

subspaces and proper ﬂats in Rn: they are not equal to Rn.

FIGURE 3consists of all the afﬁne combinations of points in the set. For instance, Figure 3 shows
the points studied in Example 2. Although the set of all linear combinations of b1,b2,
andb3is all of R3, the set of all afﬁne combinations is only the plane through b1,b2,
andb3. Note that p2(from Example 2) is in the plane through b1,b2, and b3, while p1
is not in that plane. Also, see Exercise 14.
The next example takes a fresh look at a familiar set—the set of all solutions of a
system AxDb.

8.2 AFFINE INDEPENDENCE
This section continues to explore the relation between linear concepts and afﬁne con-
cepts. Consider ﬁrst a set of three vectors in R3, say SD fv1;v2;v3g. IfSis linearly
dependent, then one of the vectors is a linear combination of the other two vectors. What
happens when one of the vectors is an afﬁne combination of the others? For instance,
suppose that
v3D.1 t/v1Ctv2;for some tinR.
Then
.1 t/v1Ctv2 v3D0:
This is a linear dependence relation because not all the weights are zero. But more is
true—the weights in the dependence relation sum to 0:
.1 t/CtC. 1/D0:
This is the additional property needed to deﬁne afﬁne dependence .

real numbers c1; : : : ; c p, not all zero, such that

Otherwise, the set is afﬁnely independent .

8.2 Affine Independence 447
An afﬁne combination is a special type of linear combination, and afﬁne depen-
dence is a restricted type of linear dependence. Thus, each afﬁnely dependent set is
automatically linearly dependent.
A setfv1gof only one point (even the zero vector) must be afﬁnely independent
because the required properties of the coefﬁcients cicannot be satisﬁed when there is
only one coefﬁcient. For fv1g, the ﬁrst equation in (1) is just c1D0, and yet at least one
(the only one) coefﬁcient must be nonzero.
Exercise 13 asks you to show that an indexed set fv1;v2gis afﬁnely dependent if
and only if v1Dv2. The following theorem handles the general case and shows how
the concept of afﬁne dependence is analogous to that of linear dependence. Parts (c) and
(d) give useful methods for determining whether a set is afﬁnely dependent. Recall from
Section 8.1 that if vis inRn, then the vector QvinRnC1denotes the homogeneous form
ofv.
T H E O R E M 5 Given an indexed set SD fv1; : : : ; vpginRn, with p2, the following state-
ments are logically equivalent. That is, either they are all true statements or they
are all false.
a.Sis afﬁnely dependent.
b.One of the points in Sis an afﬁne combination of the other points in S.
c.The set fv2 v1; : : : ; vp v1ginRnis linearly dependent.
d. The set fQv1; : : : ;Qvpgof homogeneous forms in RnC1is linearly dependent.
PROOF Suppose statement (a) is true, and let c1; : : : ; c psatisfy (1). By renaming the
points if necessary, one may assume that c1¤0and divide both equations in (1) by c1,
so that 1C.c2=c1/C  C .cp=c1/D0and
v1D. c2=c1/v2C  C . cp=c1/vp (2)
Note that the coefﬁcients on the right side of (2) sum to 1. Thus (a) implies (b). Now,
suppose that (b) is true. By renaming the points if necessary, one may assume that
v1Dc2v2C  C cpvp, where c2C  C cpD1. Then
.c2C  C cp/v1Dc2v2C  C cpvp (3)
and
c2.v2 v1/C  C cp.vp v1/D0 (4)
Not all of c2; : : : ; c pcan be zero because they sum to 1. So (b) implies (c).
Next, if (c) is true, then there exist weights c2; : : : ; c p, not all zero, such that (4)
holds. Rewrite (4) as (3) and set c1D  .c2C  C cp/. Then c1C  C cpD0. Thus
(3) shows that (1) is true. So (c) implies (a), which proves that (a), (b), and (c) are
logically equivalent. Finally, (d) is equivalent to (a) because the two equations in (1)
are equivalent to the following equation involving the homogeneous forms of the points
inS:
c1v1
1
C  C cpvp
1
D0
0
In statement (c) of Theorem 5, v1could be replaced by any of the other points in
the list v1; : : : ; vp. Only the notation in the proof would change. So, to test whether a
set is afﬁnely dependent, subtract one point in the set from the other points, and check
whether the translated set of p 1points is linearly dependent.

Barycentric Coordinates
The deﬁnition of barycentric coordinates depends on the following afﬁne version of the
Unique Representation Theorem in Section 4.4. See Exercise 17 in this section for the
proof.
T H E O R E M 6 LetSD fv1; : : : ; vkgbe an afﬁnely independent set in Rn. Then each pin aff S
has a unique representation as an afﬁne combination of v1; : : : ; vk. That is, for

Barycentric coordinates have both physical and geometric interpretations. They
were originally deﬁned by A. F. Moebius in 1827 for a point pinside a triangular
region with vertices a,b, and c. He wrote that the barycentric coordinates of pare
three nonnegative numbers ma; mb, and mcsuch that pis the center of mass of a system
consisting of the triangle (with no mass) and masses ma,mb, andmcat the corresponding
vertices. The masses are uniquely determined by requiring that their sum be 1. This view
is still useful in physics today.1
Figure 4 gives a geometric interpretation to the barycentric coordinates in Example
4, showing the triangle abcand three small triangles pbc,apc, and abp. The
areas of the small triangles are proportional to the barycentric coordinates of p. In fact,

1See Exercise 29 in Section 1.3. In astronomy, however, “barycentric coordinates” usually refer to ordinary
R3coordinates of points in what is now called the International Celestial Reference System , a Cartesian
coordinate system for outer space, with the origin at the center of mass (the barycenter) of the solar system.

When a point is not inside the triangle (or tetrahedron), some of the barycentric
coordinates will be negative. The case of a triangle is illustrated in Figure 5, for vertices
a,b,c, and coordinate values r; s; t , as above. The points on the line through bandc, for
instance, have rD0because they are afﬁne combinations of only bandc. The parallel
line through aidentiﬁes points with rD1.

Barycentric Coordinates in Computer Graphics
When working with geometric objects in a computer graphics program, a designer may
use a “wire-frame” approximation to an object at certain key points in the process
of creating a realistic ﬁnal image.2For instance, if the surface of part of an object
consists of small ﬂat triangular surfaces, then a graphics program can easily add color,
lighting, and shading to each small surface when that information is known only at the
vertices. Barycentric coordinates provide the tool for smoothly interpolating the vertex
information over the interior of a triangle. The interpolation at a point is simply the
linear combination of the vertex values using the barycentric coordinates as weights.
Colors on a computer screen are often described by RGB coordinates. A triple
.r; g; b/ indicates the amount of each color—red, green, and blue—with the parameters
varying from 0to1. For example, pure red is .1; 0; 0/ , white is .1; 1; 1/ , and black is
.0; 0; 0/ .

One of the last steps in preparing a graphics scene for display on a computer screen
is to remove “hidden surfaces” that should not be visible on the screen. Imagine the
viewing screen as consisting of, say, a million pixels, and consider a ray or “line of sight”
from the viewer’s eye through a pixel and into the collection of objects that make up the
3D display. The color and other information displayed in the pixel on the screen should
come from the object that the ray ﬁrst intersects. See Figure 7. When the objects in
the graphics scene are approximated by wire frames with triangular patches, the hidden
surface problem can be solved using barycentric coordinates.
FIGURE 7 A ray from the eye through the screen to the
nearest object.
The mathematics for ﬁnding the ray-triangle intersections can also be used to per-
form extremely realistic shading of objects. Currently, this ray-tracing method is too
slow for real-time rendering, but recent advances in hardware implementation may
change that in the future.3

14. The conditions for afﬁne dependence are stronger than those
for linear dependence, so an afﬁnely dependent set is auto-
matically linearly dependent. Also, a linearly independent set
cannot be afﬁnely dependent and therefore must be afﬁnely
independent. Construct two linearly dependent indexed sets
S1andS2inR2such that S1is afﬁnely dependent and S2
is afﬁnely independent. In each case, the set should contain
either one, two, or three nonzero points.

is inside the triangle Tand all its barycentric coordinates
are positive. Point p1has coordinates . ;C;C/. Its third
coordinate is positive because p1is on the v3side of the
line through v1andv2. Its ﬁrst coordinate is negative
because p1is opposite the v1side of the line through v2
andv3. Point p2is on the v2v3edge of T. Its coordinates

termine the signs of the barycentric coordinates of points

SOLUTIONS TO PRACTICE PROBLEMS
1.From Example 1, the problem is to determine if the points are afﬁnely dependent.
Use the method of Example 2 and subtract one point from the other two. If one of
these two new points is a multiple of the other, the original three points lie on a line.
2.The proof of Theorem 5 essentially points out that an afﬁne dependence relation
among points corresponds to a linear dependence relation among the homogeneous
forms of the points, using the same weights. So, row reduce:

View this matrix as the coefﬁcient matrix for AxD0with four variables. Then x4
is free, x1Dx4,x2D  1:25x 4, and x3D  :75x 4. One solution is x1Dx4D4,
x2D  5, and x3D  3. A linear dependence among the homogeneous forms is

Another solution method is to translate the problem to the origin by subtracting
v1from the other points, ﬁnd a linear dependence relation among the translated
points, and then rearrange the terms. The amount of arithmetic involved is about
the same as in the approach shown above.
8.3 CONVEX COMBINATIONS
Section 8.1 considered special linear combinations of the form
c1v1Cc2v2C  C ckvk;where c1Cc2C  C ckD1
This section further restricts the weights to be nonnegative.
D E F I N I T I O N Aconvex combination of points v1;v2; : : : ; vkinRnis a linear combination of
the form
c1v1Cc2v2C  C ckvk
such that c1Cc2C  C ckD1andci0for all i. The set of all convex
combinations of points in a set Sis called the convex hull ofS, denoted by conv S.
The convex hull of a single point v1is just the set fv1g, the same as the afﬁne hull.
In other cases, the convex hull is properly contained in the afﬁne hull. Recall that the
afﬁne hull of distinct points v1andv2is the line
yD.1 t/v1Ctv2;withtinR
Because the weights in a convex combination are nonnegative, the points in conv fv1;v2g
may be written as
yD.1 t/v1Ctv2;with0t1
which is the line segment between v1andv2, hereafter denoted by v1v2.
If a set Sis afﬁnely independent and if p2affS, then p2conv Sif and only if
the barycentric coordinates of pare nonnegative. Example 1 shows a special situation
in which Sis much more than just afﬁnely independent.

Span S, affS, and conv S. Then do the same for p2.
SOLUTION Ifp1is at least a linear combination of the points in S, then the weights are
easily found, because Sis an orthogonal set. Let Wbe the subspace spanned by S. A cal-
culation as in Section 6.3 shows that the orthogonal projection of p1ontoWisp1itself:

This shows that p1isinSpan S. Also, since the coefﬁcients sum to 1, p1is in aff S. In
fact, p1is in conv S, because the coefﬁcients are also nonnegative.
Forp2, a similar calculation shows that projWp2¤p2. Since projWp2is the closest
point in Span Stop2, the point p2is not in Span S. In particular, p2cannot be in aff S
or conv S.
Recall that a set Sis afﬁne if it contains all lines determined by pairs of points in S.
When attention is restricted to convex combinations, the appropriate condition involves
line segments rather than lines.
D E F I N I T I O N A set Sisconvex if for each p;q2S, the line segment pqis contained in S.
Intuitively, a set Sis convex if every two points in the set can “see” each other
without the line of sight leaving the set. Figure 1 illustrates this idea.
Convex Convex Not convex
FIGURE 1
The next result is analogous to Theorem 2 for afﬁne sets.
T H E O R E M 7 A set Sis convex if and only if every convex combination of points of Slies in
S. That is, Sis convex if and only if SDconv S.
PROOF The argument is similar to the proof of Theorem 2. The only difference is
in the induction step. When taking a convex combination of kC1points, consider
yDc1v1C  C ckvkCckC1vkC1, where c1C  C ckC1D1and0ci1for

prove. If ckC1< 1, lettDc1C  C ck. Then tD1 ckC1> 0and

CckC1vkC1 (1)
By the induction hypothesis, the point zD.c1=t/v1C  C .ck=t/vkis inS, since the
nonnegative coefﬁcients sum to 1. Thus equation (1) displays yas a convex combination
of two points in S. By the principle of induction, every convex combination of such
points lies in S.
Theorem 9 below provides a more geometric characterization of the convex hull
of a set. It requires a preliminary result on intersections of sets. Recall from Section
4.1 (Exercise 32) that the intersection of two subspaces is itself a subspace. In fact, the
intersection of any collection of subspaces is itself a subspace. A similar result holds for
afﬁne sets and convex sets.
T H E O R E M 8 LetfSW2Agbe any collection of convex sets. Then \2ASis convex. If
fTW2Bgis any collection of afﬁne sets, then \2BTis afﬁne.
PROOF Ifpandqare in\S, then pandqare in each S. Since each Sis convex,
the line segment between pandqis inSfor all and hence that segment is contained
in\S. The proof of the afﬁne case is similar.
T H E O R E M 9 For any set S, the convex hull of Sis the intersection of all the convex sets that
contain S.
PROOF LetTdenote the intersection of all the convex sets containing S. Since conv S
is a convex set containing S, it follows that Tconv S. On the other hand, let Cbe
any convex set containing S. Then Ccontains every convex combination of points of
C(Theorem 7), and hence also contains every convex combination of points of the
subset S. That is, conv SC. Since this is true for every convex set Ccontaining S,
it is also true for the intersection of them all. That is, conv ST.
Theorem 9 shows that conv Sis in a natural sense the “smallest” convex set con-
taining S. For example, consider a set Sthat lies inside some large rectangle in R2, and
imagine stretching a rubber band around the outside of S. As the rubber band contracts
around S, it outlines the boundary of the convex hull of S. Or to use another analogy,
the convex hull of Sﬁllsinall the holes in the inside of Sand ﬁlls outall the dents in
the boundary of S.

SOLUTION Every point in conv Smust lie on a line segment that connects two points
ofS. The dashed line in Figure 3 indicates that, except for the origin, the positive y-
axis is not in conv S, because the origin is the only point of Son the y-axis. It may
seem reasonable that Figure 3 does show conv S, but how can you be sure that the point
.10 2; 104/, for example, is on a line segment from the origin to a point on the curve in
S?
Consider any point pin the shaded region of Figure 3, say

The following theorem is basic in the study of convex sets. It was ﬁrst proved by
Constantin Caratheodory in 1907. If pis in the convex hull of S, then, by deﬁnition, p
must be a convex combination of points of S. But the deﬁnition makes no stipulation
as to how many points of Sare required to make the combination. Caratheodory’s
remarkable theorem says that in an n-dimensional space, the number of points of S
in the convex combination never has to be more than nC1.
T H E O R E M 1 0 (Caratheodory) IfSis a nonempty subset of Rn, then every point in conv Scan
be expressed as a convex combination of nC1or fewer points of S.
PROOF Given pin conv S, one may write pDc1v1C  C ckvk, where vi2S;
c1C  C ckD1, and ci0, for some kandiD1; : : : ; k . The goal is to show that
such an expression exists for pwithknC1.
Ifk > n C1, thenfv1; : : : ; vkgis afﬁnely dependent, by Exercise 12 in Section 8.2.
Thus there exist scalars d1; : : : ; d k, not all zero, such that

Consider the two equations
c1v1Cc2v2C  C ckvkDp
and
d1v1Cd2v2C  C dkvkD0
By subtracting an appropriate multiple of the second equation from the ﬁrst, we now
eliminate one of the viterms and obtain a convex combination of fewer than kelements
ofSthat is equal to p.

This result cannot, in general, be improved by decreasing the required number of
points. Indeed, given any three non-collinear points in R2, the centroid of the triangle
formed by them is in the convex hull of all three, but is not in the convex hull of any two.

8.4 HYPERPLANES
Hyperplanes play a special role in the geometry of Rnbecause they divide the space into
two disjoint pieces, just as a plane separates R3into two parts and a line cuts through
R2. The key to working with hyperplanes is to use simple implicit descriptions, rather
than the explicit or parametric representations of lines and planes used in the earlier
work with afﬁne sets.1
An implicit equation of a line in R2has the form axCbyDd. An implicit equa-
tion of a plane in R3has the form axCbyCc´Dd. Both equations describe the
line or plane as the set of all points at which a linear expression (also called a linear
functional ) has a ﬁxed value, d.
D E F I N I T I O N Alinear functional onRnis a linear transformation ffromRnintoR. For each
scalar dinR, the symbol f:ddenotes the set of all xinRnat which the value
offisd. That is,
f:d is the set fx2RnWf .x/Ddg
Thezero functional is the transformation such that f .x/D0for all xinRn. All
other linear functionals on Rnare said to be nonzero .
EXAMPLE 1 InR2, the line x 4yD13is a hyperplane in R2, and it is the set
of points at which the linear functional f .x; y/ Dx 4yhas the value 13. That is, the
line is the set f:13.
EXAMPLE 2 InR3, the plane 5x 2yC3´D21is a hyperplane, the set of points
at which the linear functional g.x; y; ´/ D5x 2yC3´has the value 21. This hyper-
plane is the set g:21.
Iffis a linear functional on Rn, then the standard matrix of this linear transforma-
tionfis a1nmatrix A, sayADa1a2an. So
f:0is the same as fx2RnWAxD0g DNulA (1)
1Parametric representations were introduced in Section 1.5.
SECOND REVISED PAGES


--- Page 481 ---
464 CHAPTER 8 The Geometry of Vector Spaces
Iffis a nonzero functional, then rank AD1, and dim Nul ADn 1, by the Rank
Theorem.2Thus, the subspace fW0has dimension n 1and so is a hyperplane. Also,
ifdis any number in R, then
f:d is the same as fx2RnWAxDdg (2)
Recall from Theorem 6 in Section 1.5 that the set of solutions of AxDbis obtained
by translating the solution set of AxD0, using any particular solution pofAxDb.
When Ais the standard matrix of the transformation f, this theorem says that
f:dDfW0Cpfor any pinfWd (3)
Thus the sets fWdare hyperplanes parallel to fW0. See Figure 1.

FIGURE 1 Parallel hyperplanes,

When Ais a1nmatrix, the equation AxDdmay be written with an inner
product nx, using ninRnwith the same entries as A. Thus, from (2),
f:d is the same as fx2RnWnxDdg (4)
Then f:0D fx2RnWnxD0g, which shows that f:0is the orthogonal comple-
ment of the subspace spanned by n. In the terminology of calculus and geometry for R3,
nis called a normal vector to f:0. (A “normal” vector in this sense need not have unit
length.) Also, nis said to be normal to each parallel hyperplane f:d, even though
nxis not zero when d¤0.
Another name for f:dis alevel set off, and nis sometimes called the gradient
offwhen f .x/Dnxfor each x.

tions of hyperplanes. Example 4 begins with an implicit form.

So far, every hyperplane examined has been described as f:dfor some linear
functional fand some dinR, or equivalently as fx2RnWnxDdgfor some ninRn.
The following theorem shows that every hyperplane has these equivalent descriptions.
T H E O R E M 1 1 A subset HofRnis a hyperplane if and only if HDf:dfor some nonzero

8.4 Hyperplanes 467
PROOF Suppose that His a hyperplane, take p2H, and let H0DH p. Then H0
is an .n 1/-dimensional subspace. Next, take any point ythat is not in H0. By the
Orthogonal Decomposition Theorem in Section 6.3,
yDy1Cn
where y1is a vector in H0andnis orthogonal to every vector in H0. The function f
deﬁned by
f .x/Dnxforx2Rn
is a linear functional, by properties of the inner product. Now, f:0is a hyperplane that
contains H0, by construction of n. It follows that
H0Df:0
[Argument: H0contains a basis Sofn 1vectors, and since Sis in the .n 1/-
dimensional subspace f:0,Smust also be a basis for f:0, by the Basis Theorem.]
Finally, let dDf .p/Dnp. Then, as in (3) shown earlier,
f:dDf:0CpDH0CpDH
The converse statement that f:dis a hyperplane follows from (1) and (3) above.
Many important applications of hyperplanes depend on the possibility of “separat-
ing” two sets by a hyperplane. Intuitively, this means that one of the sets is on one side
of the hyperplane and the other set is on the other side. The following terminology and
notation will help to make this idea more precise.
TOPOLOGY IN Rn: TERMS AND FACTS
For any point pinRnand any real  > 0 , the open ball B.p; /with center pand

Given a set SinRn, a point pis an interior point ofSif there exists a  > 0
such that B.p; /S. If every open ball centered at pintersects both Sand the
complement of S, then pis called a boundary point ofS. A set is open if it
contains none of its boundary points. (This is equivalent to saying that all of its
points are interior points.) A set is closed if it contains all of its boundary points.
(IfScontains some but not all of its boundary points, then Sis neither open nor

Notation: Iffis a linear functional, then f .A/dmeans f .x/dfor each x2A.
Corresponding notations will be used when the inequalities are reversed or when they
are strict.
D E F I N I T I O N The hyperplane HDf:dseparates two sets AandBif one of the following
holds:
(i)f .A/dandf .B/d, or
(ii)f .A/dandf .B/d.
If in the conditions above all the weak inequalities are replaced by strict inequal-
ities, then His said to strictly separate AandB.
Notice that strict separation requires that the two sets be disjoint, while mere sep-
aration does not. Indeed, if two circles in the plane are externally tangent, then their
common tangent line separates them (but does not separate them strictly).
Although it is necessary that two sets be disjoint in order to strictly separate them,
this condition is not sufﬁcient, even for closed convex sets. For example, let

Then AandBare disjoint closed convex sets, but they cannot be strictly separated
by a hyperplane (line in R2). See Figure 4. Thus the problem of separating (or strictly
separating) two sets by a hyperplane is more complex than it might at ﬁrst appear.

There are many interesting conditions on the sets AandBthat imply the existence
of a separating hyperplane, but the following two theorems are sufﬁcient for this section.
The proof of the ﬁrst theorem requires quite a bit of preliminary material,3but the second
theorem follows easily from the ﬁrst.
T H E O R E M 1 2 Suppose AandBare nonempty convex sets such that Ais compact and Bis
closed. Then there exists a hyperplane Hthat strictly separates AandBif and
only if A\BD¿.
T H E O R E M 1 3 Suppose AandBare nonempty compact sets. Then there exists a hyperplane that
strictly separates AandBif and only if .conv A/\.conv B/D¿.

8.4 Hyperplanes 469
PROOF Suppose that .conv A/\.conv B/D¿. Since the convex hull of a compact
set is compact, Theorem 12 ensures that there is a hyperplane Hthat strictly separates
conv Aand conv B. Clearly, Halso strictly separates the smaller sets AandB.
Conversely, suppose the hyperplane HDf:dstrictly separates AandB. With-
out loss of generality, assume that f .A/ < d andf .B/ > d . Let xDc1x1C  C ckxk
be any convex combination of elements of A. Then
f .x/Dc1f .x1/C  C ckf .xk/ < c 1dC  C ckdDd
since c1C  C ckD1. Thus f .conv A/ < d . Likewise, f .conv B/ > d , soHD
f:dstrictly separates conv Aand conv B. By Theorem 12, conv Aand conv Bmust
be disjoint.

f .x 1; x2; x3/D2x1 3x2Cx3, does not separate AandB. Is there a hyperplane par-
allel to Hthat does separate AandB? Do the convex hulls of AandBintersect?
SOLUTION Evaluate the linear functional fat each of the points in AandB:
f .a1/D2; f . a2/D  11; f . a3/D  6; f . b1/D4; and f .b2/D12
Since f .b1/D4is less than 5 and f .b2/D12is greater than 5, points of Blie on both
sides of HDf:5and so Hdoes not separate AandB.
Since f .A/ < 3 andf .B/ > 3 , the parallel hyperplane f:3strictly separates A
andB. By Theorem 13, .conv A/\.conv B/D¿.
Caution: If there were no hyperplane parallel to Hthat strictly separated AandB,
this would notnecessarily imply that their convex hulls intersect. It might be that some
other hyperplane not parallel to Hwould strictly separate them.

This section studies geometric properties of an important class of compact convex sets
called polytopes. These sets arise in all sorts of applications, including game theory
(Section 9.1), linear programming (Sections 9.2 to 9.4), and more general optimization
problems, such as the design of feedback controls for engineering systems.

472 CHAPTER 8 The Geometry of Vector Spaces
Apolytope inRnis the convex hull of a ﬁnite set of points. In R2, a polytope
is simply a polygon. In R3, a polytope is called a polyhedron. Important features of
a polyhedron are its faces, edges, and vertices. For example, the cube has 6 square
faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices. The following deﬁnitions provide terminology for higher
dimensions as well as R2andR3. Recall that the dimension of a set in Rnis the dimen-
sion of the smallest ﬂat that contains it. Also, note that a polytope is a special type of
compact convex set, because a ﬁnite set in Rnis compact and the convex hull of this set
is compact, by the theorem in the topology terms and facts box in Section 8.4.
D E F I N I T I O N LetSbe a compact convex subset of Rn. A nonempty subset FofSis called
a (proper) face ofSifF¤Sand there exists a hyperplane HDf:dsuch
thatFDS\Hand either f .S/dorf .S/d. The hyperplane His called
asupporting hyperplane toS. If the dimension of Fisk, then Fis called a
k-face ofS.
IfPis a polytope of dimension k, then Pis called a k-polytope . A 0-face of P
is called a vertex (plural: vertices ), a 1-face is an edge , and a .k 1/-dimensional
face is a facet ofS.
EXAMPLE 1 Suppose Sis a cube in R3. When a plane His translated through
R3until it just touches (supports) the cube but does not cut through the interior of the
cube, there are three possibilities for H\S, depending on the orientation of H. (See
Figure 1.)
H\Smay be a 2-dimensional square face (facet) of the cube.
H\Smay be a 1-dimensional edge of the cube.
H\Smay be a 0-dimensional vertex of the cube.
H /H20669 S is 2-dimensional. H /H20669 S is 1-dimensional. H /H20669 S is 0-dimensional.SS S

Most applications of polytopes involve the vertices in some way, because they have
a special property that is identiﬁed in the following deﬁnition.
D E F I N I T I O N LetSbe a convex set. A point pinSis called an extreme point ofSifpis
not in the interior of any line segment that lies in S. More precisely, if x;y2S
andp2xy, then pDxorpDy. The set of all extreme points of Sis called the
proﬁle ofS.

8.5 Polytopes 473
A vertex of any compact convex set Sis automatically an extreme point of S. This
fact is proved during the proof of Theorem 14, below. In working with a polytope, say
PDconvfv1; : : : ; vkgforv1; : : : ; vkinRn, it is usually helpful to know that v1; : : : ; vk
are the extreme points of P. However, such a list might contain extraneous points. For
example, some vector vicould be the midpoint of an edge of the polytope. Of course,
in this case viis not really needed to generate the convex hull. The following deﬁnition
describes the property of the vertices that will make them all extreme points.
D E F I N I T I O N The set fv1; : : : ; vkgis a minimal representation of the polytope PifPD
convfv1; : : : ; vkgand for each iD1; : : : ; k; vi62convfvjWj¤ig.
Every polytope has a minimal representation. For if PDconvfv1; : : : ; vkgand if
some viis a convex combination of the other points, then vimay be deleted from the
set of points without changing the convex hull. This process may be repeated until the
minimal representation is left. It can be shown that the minimal representation is unique.
T H E O R E M 1 4 Suppose MD fv1; : : : ; vkgis the minimal representation of the polytope P. Then
the following three statements are equivalent:
a.p2M.
b.pis a vertex of P.
c.pis an extreme point of P.
PROOF (a))(b) Suppose p2Mand let QDconvfvWv2Mandv¤pg. It fol-
HH '

FIGURE 2lows from the deﬁnition of Mthatp62Q, and since Qis compact, Theorem 13 implies
the existence of a hyperplane H0that strictly separates fpgandQ. LetHbe the hyper-
plane through pparallel to H0. See Figure 2.
Then Qlies in one of the closed half-spaces HCbounded by Hand so PHC.
Thus Hsupports Patp. Furthermore, pis the only point of Pthat can lie on H, so
H\PD fpgandpis a vertex of P.
(b))(c) Let pbe a vertex of P. Then there exists a hyperplane HDf:dsuch
thatH\PD fpgandf .P / d. Ifpwere not an extreme point, then there would
exist points xandyinPsuch that pD.1 c/xCcywith0 < c < 1 . That is,

this part of the proof does not depend on Pbeing a polytope. It holds for any compact
convex set.)

474 CHAPTER 8 The Geometry of Vector Spaces
EXAMPLE 2 Recall that the proﬁle of a set Sis the set of extreme points of S.
Theorem 14 shows that the proﬁle of a polygon in R2is the set of vertices. (See Figure 3.)
The proﬁle of a closed ball is its boundary. An open set has no extreme points, so its
proﬁle is empty. A closed half-space has no extreme points, so its proﬁle is empty.
FIGURE 3
Exercise 18 asks you to show that a point pin a convex set Sis an extreme point
ofSif and only if, when pis removed from S, the remaining points still form a convex
set. It follows that if Sis any subset of Ssuch that conv Sis equal to S, then Smust
contain the proﬁle of S. The sets in Example 2 show that in general Smay have to be
larger than the proﬁle of S. It is true, however, that when Sis compact, we may actually
takeSto be the proﬁle of S, as Theorem 15 will show. Thus every nonempty compact
convex set Shas an extreme point, and the set of all extreme points is the smallest subset
ofSwhose convex hull is equal to S.
T H E O R E M 1 5 LetSbe a nonempty compact convex set. Then Sis the convex hull of its proﬁle
(the set of extreme points of S).
PROOF The proof is by induction on the dimension of the set S.1
One important application of Theorem 15 is the following theorem. It is one of the
key theoretical results in the development of linear programming. Linear functionals
are continuous, and continuous functions always attain their maximum and minimum
on a compact set. The signiﬁcance of Theorem 16 is that for compact convex sets, the
maximum (and minimum) is actually attained at an extreme point of S.
T H E O R E M 1 6 Letfbe a linear functional deﬁned on a nonempty compact convex set S. Then
there exist extreme points OvandOwofSsuch that
f .Ov/Dmaxv2Sf .v/and f .Ow/Dminv2Sf .v/
PROOF Assume that fattains its maximum monSat some point v0inS. That is,
f .v0/Dm. We wish to show that there exists an extreme point in Swith the same
property. By Theorem 15, v0is a convex combination of the extreme points of S. That
is, there exist extreme points v1; : : : ; vkofSand nonnegative c1; : : : ; c ksuch that

The situation illustrated in Example 3 for R2also applies in higher dimensions. The
maximum value of a linear functional fon a polytope Poccurs at the intersection of
a supporting hyperplane and P. This intersection is either a single extreme point of P,
or the convex hull of 2 or more extreme points of P. In either case, the intersection is a
polytope, and its extreme points form a subset of the extreme points of P.
By deﬁnition, a polytope is the convex hull of a ﬁnite set of points. This is an explicit
representation of the polytope since it identiﬁes points in the set. A polytope may also
be represented implicitly as the intersection of a ﬁnite number of closed half-spaces.
Example 4 illustrates this in R2.

SOLUTION The condition x0places Pin the ﬁrst quadrant of R2, a typical con-
dition in linear programming problems. The three inequalities in Axbinvolve three
boundary lines:
.1/ x 1C3x2D18 .2/ x 1Cx2D8 .3/ 3x 1C2x2D21
All three lines have negative slopes, so a general idea of the shape of Pis easy to
visualize. Even a rough sketch of the graphs of these lines will reveal that .0; 0/ ,.7; 0/ ,
and.0; 6/ are vertices of the polytope P.
What about the intersections of the lines (1), (2), and (3)? Sometimes it is clear
from the graph which intersections to include. But if not, then the following algebraic
procedure will work well:
When an intersection point is found that corresponds to two inequalities, test it
in the other inequalities to see whether the point is in the polytope.
The intersection of (1) and (2) is p12D.3; 5/ . Both coordinates are nonnegative,
sop12satisﬁes all inequalities except possibly the third inequality. Test this:
3.3/C2.5/D19 < 21
This intersection point satisﬁes the inequality for (3), so p12is in the polytope.
The intersection of (2) and (3) is p23D.5; 3/ . This satisﬁes all inequalities except
possibly the inequality for (1). Test this:
1.5/C3.3/D14 < 18
This shows that p23is in the polytope.
Finally, the intersection of (1) and (3) is p13D 27

The remainder of this section discusses the construction of two basic polytopes
inR3(and higher dimensions). The ﬁrst appears in linear programming problems, the
subject of Chapter 9. Both polytopes provide opportunities to visualize R4in a remark-
able way.
Simplex
Asimplex is the convex hull of an afﬁnely independent ﬁnite set of vectors. To construct
ak-dimensional simplex (or k-simplex), proceed as follows:
0-simplex S0: a single point fv1g
1-simplex S1: conv .S0[ fv2g/, with v2not in aff S0
2-simplex S2: conv .S1[ fv3g/, with v3not in aff S1
:::
k-simplex Sk: conv .Sk 1[ fvkC1g/;with vkC1not in aff Sk 1
The simplex S1is a line segment. The triangle S2comes from choosing a point
v3that is not in the line containing S1and then forming the convex hull with S1.

FIGURE 6
(See Figure 6.) The tetrahedron S3is produced by choosing a point v4not in the plane
ofS2and then forming the convex hull with S2.
Before continuing, consider some of the patterns that are appearing. The triangle S2
has three edges. Each of these edges is a line segment like S1. Where do these three line
segments come from? One of them is S1. One of them comes by joining the endpoint
v2to the new point v3. The third comes from joining the other endpoint v1tov3. You
might say that each endpoint in S1is stretched out into a line segment in S2.
The tetrahedron S3in Figure 6 has four triangular faces. One of these is the original
triangle S2, and the other three come from stretching the edges of S2out to the new
point v4. Notice too that the vertices of S2get stretched out into edges in S3. The other
edges in S3come from the edges in S2. This suggests how to “visualize” the four-
dimensional S4.
The construction of S4, called a pentatope, involves forming the convex hull of S3
with a point v5not in the 3-space of S3. A complete picture is impossible, of course,
but Figure 7 is suggestive: S4has ﬁve vertices, and any four of the vertices determine
a facet in the shape of a tetrahedron. For example, the ﬁgure emphasizes the facet with
vertices v1,v2,v4, and v5and the facet with vertices v2,v3,v4, and v5. There are ﬁve

such facets. Figure 7 identiﬁes all ten edges of S4, and these can be used to visualize
the ten triangular faces.
Figure 8 shows another representation of the 4-dimensional simplex S4. This time
the ﬁfth vertex appears “inside” the tetrahedron S3. The highlighted tetrahedral facets
also appear to be “inside” S3.

Hypercube
LetIiD0eibe the line segment from the origin 0to the standard basis vector eiinRn.
Then for ksuch that 1kn, the vector sum2
CkDI1CI2C  C Ik
is called a k-dimensional hypercube .
To visualize the construction of Ck, start with the simple cases. The hypercube C1
is the line segment I1. IfC1is translated by e2, the convex hull of its initial and ﬁnal
positions describes a square C2. (See Figure 9.) Translating C2bye3creates the cube
C3. A similar translation of C3by the vector e4yields the 4-dimensional hypercube C4.
Again, this is hard to visualize, but Figure 10 shows a 2-dimensional projection
ofC4. Each of the edges of C3is stretched into a square face of C4. And each of the
square faces of C3is stretched into a cubic face of C4. Figure 11 shows three facets
ofC4. Part (a) highlights the cube that comes from the left square face of C3. Part (b)
shows the cube that comes from the front square face of C3. And part (c) emphasizes
the cube that comes from the top square face of C3.

Figure 12 shows another representation of C4in which the translated cube is placed
“inside” C3. This makes it easier to visualize the cubic facets of C4, since there is less
distortion.
FIGURE 12 The translated image of
C3is placed “inside” C3to obtain C4.
Altogether, the 4-dimensional cube C4has eight cubic faces. Two come from the
original and translated images of C3, and six come from the square faces of C3that are
stretched into cubes. The square 2-dimensional faces of C4come from the square faces

ofC3and its translate, and the edges of C3that are stretched into squares. Thus there
are26C12D24square faces. To count the edges, take 2 times the number of edges
inC3and add the number of vertices in C3. This makes 212C8D32edges in C4.
The vertices in C4all come from C3and its translate, so there are 28D16vertices.
One of the truly remarkable results in the study of polytopes is the following for-
mula, ﬁrst proved by Leonard Euler (1707–1783). It establishes a simple relationship
between the number of faces of different dimensions in a polytope. To simplify the
statement of the formula, let fk.P / denote the number of k-dimensional faces of an
n-dimensional polytope P.3

8.6 CURVES AND SURFACES
For thousands of years, builders used long thin strips of wood to create the hull of a boat.
In more recent times, designers used long, ﬂexible metal strips to lay out the surfaces of
cars and airplanes. Weights and pegs shaped the strips into smooth curves called natural
cubic splines . The curve between two successive control points (pegs or weights) has
a parametric representation using cubic polynomials. Unfortunately, such curves have
the property that moving one control point affects the shape of the entire curve, because
of physical forces that the pegs and weights exert on the strip. Design engineers had
long wanted local control of the curve—in which movement of one control point would
affect only a small portion of the curve. In 1962, a French automotive engineer, Pierre
Bézier, solved this problem by adding extra control points and using a class of curves
now called by his name.
Bézier Curves
The curves described below play an important role in computer graphics as well as
engineering. For example, they are used in Adobe Illustrator and Macromedia Freehand,
and in application programming languages such as OpenGL. These curves permit a
program to store exact information about curved segments and surfaces in a relatively
small number of control points. All graphics commands for the segments and surfaces
have only to be computed for the control points. The special structure of these curves
also speeds up other calculations in the “graphics pipeline” that creates the ﬁnal display
on the viewing screen.
Exercises in Section 8.3 introduced quadratic Bézier curves and showed one method
for constructing Bézier curves of higher degree. The discussion here focuses on quadratic
and cubic Bézier curves, which are determined by three or four control points, denoted

byp0,p1,p2, and p3. These points can be in R2orR3, or they can be represented by
homogeneous forms in R3orR4. The standard parametric descriptions of these curves,

x.t/D.1 t/3p0C3t.1 t/2p1C3t2.1 t/p2Ct3p3 (2)
Figure 1 shows two typical curves. Usually, the curves pass through only the initial and
terminal control points, but a Bézier curve is always in the convex hull of its control
points. (See Exercises 21–24 in Section 8.3.)

FIGURE 1 Quadratic and cubic Bézier curves.
Bézier curves are useful in computer graphics because their essential properties are
preserved under the action of linear transformations and translations. For instance, if
Ais a matrix of appropriate size, then from the linearity of matrix multiplication, for
0t1,

The new control points are Ap0; : : : ; A p3. Translations of Bézier curves are considered
in Exercise 1.
The curves in Figure 1 suggest that the control points determine the tangent lines
to the curves at the initial and terminal control points. Recall from calculus that for any
parametric curve, say y.t/, the direction of the tangent line to the curve at a point y.t/
is given by the derivative y0.t/, called the tangent vector of the curve. (This derivative
is computed entry by entry.)
EXAMPLE 1 Determine how the tangent vector of the quadratic Bézier curve w.t/
is related to the control points of the curve, at tD0andtD1.
SOLUTION Write the weights in equation (1) as simple polynomials
w.t/D.1 2tCt2/p0C.2t 2t2/p1Ct2p2
Then, because differentiation is a linear transformation on functions,
w0.t/D. 2C2t/p0C.2 4t/p1C2tp2
So
w0.0/D  2p0C2p1D2.p1 p0/
w0.1/D  2p1C2p2D2.p2 p1/
The tangent vector at p0, for instance, points from p0top1, but it is twice as long as the
segment from p0top1. Notice that w0.0/D0when p1Dp0. In this case,
w.t/D.1 t2/p1Ct2p2, and the graph of w.t/is the line segment from p1

Connecting Two Bézier Curves
Two basic Bézier curves can be joined end to end, with the terminal point of the ﬁrst
curve x.t/being the initial point p2of the second curve y.t/. The combined curve is
said to have G0geometric continuity (atp2) because the two segments join at p2. If the
tangent line to curve 1atp2has a different direction than the tangent line to curve 2,
then a “corner,” or abrupt change of direction, may be apparent at p2. See Figure 2.

To avoid a sharp bend, it usually sufﬁces to adjust the curves to have what is called

That is, the derivatives x0.1/andy0.0/point in the same direction, even though their

tangent vector is continuous at p2, and the combined curve is said to have C1continuity,
orC1parametric continuity . Figure 3 shows G1continuity in (a) and C1continuity

Geometrically, (3) implies that p2lies on the line segment from p1top3. To
prove this, let tD.kC1/ 1, and note that 0 < t < 1 . Solve for kto obtain
kD.1 t/=t. When this expression is used for kin (3), a rearrangement shows

joining the two segments lies in the middle of the line segment between the adjacent

FIGURE 4 Two cubic Bézier curves.
Two curves have C2(parametric) continuity when they have C1continuity and the
second derivatives x00.1/andy00.0/are equal. This is possible for cubic Bézier curves,
but it severely limits the positions of the control points. Another class of cubic curves,
called B-splines , always have C2continuity because each pair of curves share three
control points rather than one. Graphics ﬁgures using B-splines have more control points
and consequently require more computations. Some exercises for this section examine
these curves.
Surprisingly, if x.t/andy.t/join at p3, the apparent smoothness of the curve at
p3is usually the same for both G1continuity and C1continuity. This is because the
magnitude of x0.t/is not related to the physical shape of the curve. The magnitude
reﬂects only the mathematical parameterization of the curve. For instance, if a new
vector function z.t/equals x.2t/, then the point z.t/traverses the curve from p0to
p3twice as fast as the original version, because 2treaches 1when tis:5. But, by the
chain rule of calculus, z0.t/D2x0.2t/, so the tangent vector to z.t/atp3is twice the
tangent vector to x.t/atp3.
In practice, many simple Bézier curves are joined to create graphics objects. Type-
setting programs provide one important application, because many letters in a type font
involve curved segments. Each letter in a PostScript®font, for example, is stored as a
set of control points, along with information on how to construct the “outline” of the
letter using line segments and Bézier curves. Enlarging such a letter basically requires
multiplying the coordinates of each control point by one constant scale factor. Once the
outline of the letter has been computed, the appropriate solid parts of the letter are ﬁlled
in. Figure 5 illustrates this for a character in a PostScript font. Note the control points.

The matrix whose columns are the four control points is called a geometry matrix ,G.
The44matrix of polynomial coefﬁcients is the Bézier basis matrix ,MB. Ifu.t/is
the column vector of powers of t, then the Bézier curve is given by
x.t/DGM Bu.t/ (4)
Other parametric cubic curves in computer graphics are written in this form, too. For
instance, if the entries in the matrix MBare changed appropriately, the resulting curves
are B-splines. They are “smoother” than Bézier curves, but they do not pass through any
of the control points. A Hermite cubic curve arises when the matrix MBis replaced by
a Hermite basis matrix. In this case, the columns of the geometry matrix consist of the
starting and ending points of the curves and the tangent vectors to the curves at those
points.1
The Bézier curve in equation (4) can also be “factored” in another way, to be used
in the discussion of Bézier surfaces. For convenience later, the parameter tis replaced
1The term basis matrix comes from the rows of the matrix that list the coefﬁcients of the blending poly-
nomials used to deﬁne the curve. For a cubic Bézier curve, the four polynomials are .1 t/3,3t.1 t/2,
3t2.1 t/, and t3. They form a basis for the space P3of polynomials of degree 3or less. Each entry in the
vector x.t/is a linear combination of these polynomials. The weights come from the rows of the geometry
matrix Gin (4).

This formula is not quite the same as the transpose of the product on the right of
(4), because x.s/and the control points appear in (5) without transpose symbols. The
matrix of control points in (5) is called a geometry vector . This should be viewed as a
41block (partitioned) matrix whose entries are column vectors. The matrix to the left
of the geometry vector, in the second part of (5), can be viewed as a block matrix, too,
with a scalar in each block. The partitioned matrix multiplication makes sense, because
each (vector) entry in the geometry vector can be left-multiplied by a scalar as well as
by a matrix. Thus, the column vector x.s/is represented by (5).
Bézier Surfaces
A 3D bicubic surface patch can be constructed from a set of four Bézier curves. Consider
the four geometry matrices

matrices is multiplied on the right by the following vector of weights:

The formula for x.s; t/ is a linear combination of the sixteen control points. If one
imagines that these control points are arranged in a fairly uniform rectangular array, as
in Figure 6, then the Bézier surface is controlled by a web of eight Bézier curves, four
in the “ s-direction” and four in the “ t-direction.” The surface actually passes through
the four control points at its “corners.” When it is in the middle of a larger surface, the
sixteen-point surface shares its twelve boundary control points with its neighbors.

Approximations to Curves and Surfaces
In CAD programs and in programs used to create realistic computer games, the designer
often works at a graphics workstation to compose a “scene” involving various geometric
structures. This process requires interaction between the designer and the geometric ob-
jects. Each slight repositioning of an object requires new mathematical computations by
the graphics program. Bézier curves and surfaces can be useful in this process because
they involve fewer control points than objects approximated by many polygons. This
dramatically reduces the computation time and speeds up the designer’s work.
After the scene composition, however, the ﬁnal image preparation has different
computational demands that are more easily met by objects consisting of ﬂat surfaces
and straight edges, such as polyhedra. The designer needs to render the scene, by in-
troducing light sources, adding color and texture to surfaces, and simulating reﬂections
from the surfaces.
Computing the direction of a reﬂected light at a point pon a surface, for instance,
requires knowing the directions of both the incoming light and the surface normal —
the vector perpendicular to the tangent plane at p. Computing such normal vectors is
much easier on a surface composed of, say, tiny ﬂat polygons than on a curved surface
whose normal vector changes continuously as pmoves. If p1,p2, and p3are adjacent
vertices of a ﬂat polygon, then the surface normal is just plus or minus the cross product
.p2 p1/.p2 p3/. When the polygon is small, only one normal vector is needed for
rendering the entire polygon. Also, two widely used shading routines, Gouraud shading
and Phong shading, both require a surface to be deﬁned by polygons.
As a result of these needs for ﬂat surfaces, the Bézier curves and surfaces from the
scene composition stage now are usually approximated by straight line segments and

polyhedral surfaces. The basic idea for approximating a Bézier curve or surface is to
divide the curve or surface into smaller pieces, with more and more control points.
Recursive Subdivision of Bézier Curves and Surfaces
Figure 7 shows the four control points p0; : : : ; p3for a Bézier curve, along with control
points for two new curves, each coinciding with half of the original curve. The “left”
curve begins at q0Dp0and ends at q3, at the midpoint of the original curve. The “right”
curve begins at r0Dq3and ends at r3Dp3.
p0 = q0q3 = r0
p3 = r3p1p2

FIGURE 7 Subdivision of a Bézier curve.
Figure 8 shows how the new control points enclose regions that are “thinner” than
the region enclosed by the original control points. As the distances between the control
points decrease, the control points of each curve segment also move closer to a line
segment. This variation-diminishing property of Bézier curves depends on the fact that
a Bézier curve always lies in the convex hull of the control points.
p0 = q0q3 = r0
p3 = r3p1p2

The new control points are related to the original control points by simple formulas.

The formulas for the remaining “interior” control points are also simple, but the deriva-
tion of the formulas requires some work involving the tangent vectors of the curves. By
deﬁnition, the tangent vector to a parameterized curve x.t/is the derivative x0.t/. This
vector shows the direction of the line tangent to the curve at x.t/. For the Bézier curve

interior control points q1andr2are the midpoints, respectively, of the segment from p0
top1and the segment from p2top3. When the midpoint of the segment from p1top2

FIGURE 9 Geometric structure of new control points.
This completes one step of the subdivision process. The “recursion” begins, and
both new curves are subdivided. The recursion continues to a depth at which all curves
are sufﬁciently straight. Alternatively, at each step the recursion can be “adaptive” and
not subdivide one of the two new curves if that curve is sufﬁciently straight. Once the
subdivision completely stops, the endpoints of each curve are joined by line segments,
and the scene is ready for the next step in the ﬁnal image preparation.
A Bézier bicubic surface has the same variation-diminishing property as the Bézier
curves that make up each cross-section of the surface, so the process described above
can be applied in each cross-section. With the details omitted, here is the basic strategy.
Consider the four “parallel” Bézier curves whose parameter is s, and apply the subdi-
vision process to each of them. This produces four sets of eight control points; each set
determines a curve as svaries from 0 to 1. As tvaries, however, there are eight curves,
each with four control points. Apply the subdivision process to each of these sets of
four points, creating a total of 64 control points. Adaptive recursion is possible in this
setting, too, but there are some subtleties involved.2

thep0andp3terms are the same. The p1component has been increased by  3tC4
and the p2component has been increased by 3tC1. These components move the curve
closer to p1p2than the Bézier curve. The 1=6factor is necessary to keep the sum of the
coefﬁcients equal to 1. Figure 10 compares a B-spline with a Bézier curve that has the
same control points.

This higher-order continuity is desirable in CAD applica-
tions such as automotive body design, since the curves and
surfaces appear much smoother. However, B-splines require
three times the computation of Bézier curves, for curves
of comparable length. For surfaces, B-splines require nine
times the computation of Bézier surfaces. Programmers often
choose Bézier surfaces for applications (such as an airplane
cockpit simulator) that require real-time rendering.9.A quartic Bézier curve is determined by ﬁve control points,

c.The Bézier basis matrix is a matrix whose columns are

15. Sometimes only one half of a Bézier curve needs further
subdividing. For example, subdivision of the “left” side is
accomplished with parts (a) and (c) of Exercise 13 and
equation (8). When both halves of the curve x.t/are divided,
it is possible to organize calculations efﬁciently to calculate
both left and right control points concurrently, without using
equation (8) directly.
a.Show that the tangent vectors y0.1/andz0.0/are equal.
b.Use part (a) to show that q3(which equals r0/is the
midpoint of the segment from q2tor1.
c.Using part (b) and the results of Exercises 13 and 14, write
an algorithm that computes the control points for both
y.t/andz.t/in an efﬁcient manner. The only operations
needed are sums and division by 2.
16. Explain why a cubic Bézier curve is completely determined
byx.0/,x0.0/,x.1/, and x0.1/.17. TrueType®fonts, created by Apple Computer and Adobe
Systems, use quadratic Bézier curves, while PostScript®
fonts, created by Microsoft, use cubic Bézier curves. The
cubic curves provide more ﬂexibility for typeface design,
but it is important to Microsoft that every typeface using
quadratic curves can be transformed into one that uses cubic
curves. Suppose that w.t/is a quadratic curve, with control
points p0,p1, and p2.
a.Find control points r0,r1,r2, and r3such that the cubic
Bézier curve x.t/with these control points has the prop-
erty that x.t/andw.t/have the same initial and terminal
points and the same tangent vectors at tD0andtD1.
(See Exercise 16.)

Uniqueness of the Reduced
Echelon Form
T H E O R E M Uniqueness of the Reduced Echelon Form
Eachmnmatrix Ais row equivalent to a unique reduced echelon matrix U.
PROOF The proof uses the idea from Section 4.3 that the columns of row-equivalent
matrices have exactly the same linear dependence relations.
The row reduction algorithm shows that there exists at least one such matrix U.
Suppose that Ais row equivalent to matrices UandVin reduced echelon form. The
leftmost nonzero entry in a row of Uis a “leading l.” Call the location of such a leading
1 a pivot position, and call the column that contains it a pivot column. (This deﬁnition
uses only the echelon nature of UandVand does not assume the uniqueness of the
reduced echelon form.)
The pivot columns of UandVare precisely the nonzero columns that are not
linearly dependent on the columns to their left. (This condition is satisﬁed automatically
by a ﬁrstcolumn if it is nonzero.) Since UandVare row equivalent (both being row
equivalent to A), their columns have the same linear dependence relations. Hence, the
pivot columns of UandVappear in the same locations. If there are rsuch columns,
then since UandVare in reduced echelon form, their pivot columns are the ﬁrst r
columns of the mmidentity matrix. Thus, corresponding pivot columns of UandV
are equal .
Finally, consider any nonpivot column of U, say column j. This column is either
zero or a linear combination of the pivot columns to its left (because those pivot columns
are a basis for the space spanned by the columns to the left of column j). Either case
can be expressed by writing UxD0for some xwhose jth entry is 1. Then VxD0,
too, which says that column jofVis either zero or the same linear combination of the
pivot columns of Vtoitsleft. Since corresponding pivot columns of UandVare equal,
columns jofUandVare also equal. This holds for all nonpivot columns, so VDU,
which proves that Uis unique.

Complex Numbers
Acomplex number is a number written in the form
´DaCbi
where aandbare real numbers and iis a formal symbol satisfying the relation i2D  1.
The number ais the real part of´, denoted by Re ´, and bis the imaginary part of
´, denoted by Im ´. Two complex numbers are considered equal if and only if their
real and imaginary parts are equal. For example, if ´D5C. 2/i, then Re ´D5and
Im´D  2. For simplicity, we write ´D5 2i.
A real number ais considered as a special type of complex number, by identifying
awith aC0i. Furthermore, arithmetic operations on real numbers can be extended to
the set of complex numbers.
Thecomplex number system , denoted by C, is the set of all complex numbers,
together with the following operations of addition and multiplication:
.aCbi/C.cCdi/D.aCc/C.bCd/i (1)
.aCbi/.cCdi/D.ac bd/C.adCbc/i (2)
These rules reduce to ordinary addition and multiplication of real numbers when
banddare zero in (1) and (2). It is readily checked that the usual laws of arithmetic
forRalso hold for C. For this reason, multiplication is usually computed by algebraic
expansion, as in the following example.
EXAMPLE 1 .5 2i/.3C4i/D15C20i 6i 8i2
D15C14i 8. 1/
D23C14i
That is, multiply each term of 5 2iby each term of 3C4i, use i2D  1, and write
the result in the form aCbi.
Subtraction of complex numbers ´1and´2is deﬁned by
´1 ´2D´1C. 1/´ 2
In particular, we write  ´in place of . 1/´.

Geometric Interpretation
Each complex number ´DaCbicorresponds to a point .a; b/ in the plane R2, as
in Figure 1. The horizontal axis is called the real axis because the points ( a; 0) on it
correspond to the real numbers. The vertical axis is the imaginary axis because the
points .0; b/ on it correspond to the pure imaginary numbers of the form 0Cbi, or
simply bi. The conjugate of ´is the mirror image of ´in the real axis. The absolute
value of ´is the distance from .a; b/ to the origin.

APPENDIX B Complex Numbers A5
To give a graphical representation of complex multiplication, we use polar coordi-
nates inR2. Given a nonzero complex number ´DaCbi, let'be the angle between
the positive real axis and the point .a; b/ , as in Figure 3 where   < ' . The angle
'is called the argument of´; we write 'Darg´. From trigonometry,

´DaCbiD j´j.cos'Cisin'/

FIGURE 3 Polar coordinates of ´.
Ifwis another nonzero complex number, say,
wD jwj.cos#Cisin#/
then, using standard trigonometric identities for the sine and cosine of the sum of two
angles, one can verify that
w´D jwjj´jcos.#C'/Cisin.#C'/ (4)
See Figure 4. A similar formula may be written for quotients in polar form. The formulas
for products and quotients can be stated in words as follows.
ϕ/H9277|z|z wwz
Re zIm z
/H9277 + ϕ
FIGURE 4 Multiplication with polar
coordinates.
The product of two nonzero complex numbers is given in polar form by the
product of their absolute values and the sum of their arguments. The quotient
of two nonzero complex numbers is given by the quotient of their absolute values
and the difference of their arguments.
EXAMPLE 4
a.Ifwhas absolute value 1, then wDcos#Cisin#, where #is the argument of w.
Multiplication of any nonzero number ´bywsimply rotates ´through the angle #.
b.The argument of iitself is =2 radians, so multiplication of ´byirotates ´through
an angle of =2 radians. For example, 3Ciis rotated into .3Ci/iD  1C3i.

Complex Numbers and R2
Although the elements of R2andCare in one-to-one correspondence, and the operations
of addition are essentially the same, there is a logical distinction between R2andC. In
R2we can only multiply a vector by a real scalar, whereas in Cwe can multiply any
two complex numbers to obtain a third complex number. (The dot product in R2doesn’t
count, because it produces a scalar, not an element of R2:/We use scalar notation for
elements in Cto emphasize this distinction.

23. Yes. The system is consistent because with three pivots,
there must be a pivot in the third (bottom) row of the
coefﬁcient matrix. The reduced echelon form cannot
contain a row of the form 0 0 0 0 0 1 .
25. If the coefﬁcient matrix has a pivot position in every row,
then there is a pivot position in the bottom row, and there is
no room for a pivot in the augmented column. So, the
system is consistent, by Theorem 2.

27. If a linear system is consistent, then the solution is unique if
and only if every column in the coefﬁcient matrix is a pivot
column; otherwise, there are inﬁnitely many solutions.
29. An underdetermined system always has more variables than
equations. There cannot be more basic variables than there
are equations, so there must be at least one free variable.
Such a variable may be assigned inﬁnitely many different
values. If the system is consistent, each different value of a
free variable will produce a different solution.

AxDbdoes nothave a solution for each binR4, by
Theorem 4.
19. The work in Exercise 17 shows that statement (d) in
Theorem 4 is false. So all four statements in Theorem 4 are

combination of the columns of A. Also, the columns of A
donotspanR4.
21. The matrix v1v2v3does not have a pivot in each row,
so the columns of the matrix do not span R4, by Theorem 4.

Ahas three rows.
31. a.When Ais a32matrix with two pivot positions, each
column is a pivot column. So the equation AxD0has
no free variables and hence no nontrivial solution.
b.With two pivot positions and three rows, Acannot have
a pivot in every row. So the equation AxDbcannot
have a solution for every possible b(inR3), by
Theorem 4 in Section 1.4.

35. Your example should have the property that the sum of the
entries in each row is zero. Why?
37. One answer is AD1 4

. The Study Guide shows how
to analyze the problem in order to construct A. Ifbis any
vector nota multiple of the ﬁrst column of A, then the
solution set of AxDbis empty and thus cannot be formed
by translating the solution set of AxDb. This does not
contradict Theorem 6, because that theorem applies when
the equation AxDbhas a nonempty solution set.39. Ifcis a scalar, then A.cu/DcAu, by Theorem 5(b) in
Section 1.4. If usatisﬁes AxD0, then AuD0,

1.The general solution is pGoodsD:875p Services ;withpServices
free. One equilibrium solution is pServices D1000 and
pGoodsD875. Using fractions, the general solution could be
written pGoodsD.7=8/p Services , and a natural choice of
prices might be pServices D80andpGoodsD70. Only the
ratio of the prices is important. The economic equilibrium
is unaffected by a proportional change in prices.

neither column is a multiple of the other. In this case, the

The abbreviation IMT (here and in the Study Guide ) denotes the
Invertible Matrix Theorem (Theorem 8).
1.Invertible, by the IMT. Neither column of the matrix is a
multiple of the other column, so they are linearly
independent. Also, the matrix is invertible by Theorem 4 in
Section 2.2 because the determinant is nonzero.

11.TheStudy Guide will help, but ﬁrst try to answer the
questions based on your careful reading of the text.
13. A square upper triangular matrix is invertible if and only if
all the entries on the diagonal are nonzero. Why?
Note: The answers below for Exercises 15–29 mention the IMT.
In many cases, part or all of an acceptable answer could also be
based on results that were used to establish the IMT.
15. IfAhas two identical columns then its columns are linearly
dependent. Part (e) of the IMT shows that Acannot be
invertible.
17. IfAis invertible, so is A 1, by Theorem 6 in Section 2.2.
By (e) of the IMT applied to A 1, the columns of A 1are
linearly independent.
19. By (e) of the IMT, Dis invertible. Thus the equation
DxDbhas a solution for each binR7, by (g) of the IMT.
Can you say more?
21. The matrix Gcannot be invertible, by Theorem 5 in Section
2.2 or by the paragraph following the IMT. So (g) of the
IMT is false and so is (h). The columns of Gdo not
spanRn.
23. Statement (b) of the IMT is false for K, so statements (e)
and (h) are also false. That is, the columns of Kare linearly
dependent and the columns do notspanRn.
25. Hint: Use the IMT ﬁrst.
27. LetWbe the inverse of AB. Then ABW DIand
A.BW / DI. Unfortunately, this equation by itself does
not prove that Ais invertible. Why not? Finish the proof
before you check the Study Guide .
29. Since the transformation x7!Axis not one-to-one,
statement (f) of the IMT is false. Then (i) is also false and
the transformation x7!Axdoes not map RnontoRn. Also,
Ais not invertible, which implies that the transformation
x7!Axis not invertible, by Theorem 9.
31. Hint: If the equation AxDbhas a solution for each b, then
Ahas a pivot in each row (Theorem 4 in Section 1.4).
Could there be free variables in an equation AxDb?
33. Hint: First show that the standard matrix of Tis invertible.
Then use a theorem or theorems to show that
T 1.x/DBx, where BD7 9

35. Hint: To show that Tis one-to-one, suppose that
T .u/DT .v/for some vectors uandvinRn. Deduce
thatuDv. To show that Tis onto, suppose yrepresents
an arbitrary vector in Rnand use the inverse Sto produce

anxsuch that T .x/Dy. A second proof can be given
using Theorem 9 together with a theorem from
Section 1.9.
37. Hint: Consider the standard matrices of TandU.
39. Given any vinRn, we may write vDT .x) for some x,
because Tis an onto mapping. Then, the assumed
properties of SandUshow that S.v/DS.T . x//D
xandU.v/DU.T . x//Dx. SoS.v/andU.v/are equal
for each v. That is, SandUare the same function from Rn
intoRn.
41. [M]a.The exact solution of (3) is x1D3:94 and
x2D:49. The exact solution of (4) is x1D2:90 and
x2D2:00.
b.When the solution of (4) is used as an approximation for
the solution in (3), the error in using the value of 2.90
forx1is about 26%, and the error in using 2.0 for x2is
about 308%.
c.The condition number of the coefﬁcient matrix is 3363.
The percentage change in the solution from (3) to (4) is
about 7700 times the percentage change in the right side
of the equation. This is the same order of magnitude as
the condition number. The condition number gives a
rough measure of how sensitive the solution of AxDb
can be to changes in b. Further information about the
condition number is given at the end of Chapter 6 and in
Chapter 7.
43. [M] cond .A/69;000 , which is between 104and105. So
about 4 or 5 digits of accuracy may be lost. Several
experiments with MATLAB should verify that xandx1
agree to 11 or 12 digits.
45. [M] Some versions of MATLAB issue a warning when
asked to invert a Hilbert matrix of order about 12 or larger
using ﬂoating-point arithmetic. The product AA 1should
have several off-diagonal entries that are far from being
zero. If not, try a larger matrix.

15. [M]x.12/is the ﬁrst vector whose entries are accurate to the
nearest thousand. The calculation of x.12/takes about
1260 ﬂops, while row reduction of.I C/ d
takes
only about 550 ﬂops. If Cis larger than 2020, then fewer
ﬂops are needed to compute x.12/by iteration than to
compute the equilibrium vector xby row reduction. As the
size of Cgrows, the advantage of the iterative method
increases. Also, because Cbecomes more sparse for larger
models of the economy, fewer iterations are needed for
reasonable accuracy.

13. Columns 1, 3, and 4 of the original matrix form a basis for
H, so dim HD3.
15. ColADR3, because Ahas a pivot in each row, and so the
columns of AspanR3. NulAcannot equalR2, because
NulAis a subspace of R5. It is true, however, that Nul Ais
two-dimensional. Reason: The equation AxD0has two
free variables, because Ahas ﬁve columns and only three of
them are pivot columns.
17. See the Study Guide after you write your justiﬁcations.
19. The fact that the solution space of AxD0has a basis of
three vectors means that dim Nul AD3. Since a 57
matrix Ahas seven columns, the Rank Theorem shows that
rankAD7 dim Nul AD4. See the Study Guide for a
justiﬁcation that does not explicitly mention the Rank
Theorem.
21. A76matrix has six columns. By the Rank Theorem,
dim Nul AD6 rankA. Since the rank is four,
dim Nul AD2. That is, the dimension of the solution space
ofAxD0is two.
23. A34matrix Awith a two-dimensional column space has
two pivot columns. The remaining two columns will
correspond to free variables in the equation AxD0. So the
desired construction is possible. There are six possible
locations for the two pivot columns, one of which is2
4  
0  
0 0 0 03
5. A simple construction is to take
two vectors in R3that are obviously not linearly dependent
and place them in a matrix along with a copy of each vector,
in any order. The resulting matrix will obviously have a
two-dimensional column space. There is no need to worry
about whether Nul Ahas the correct dimension, since this is
guaranteed by the Rank Theorem: dim Nul AD4 rankA.

5.The vector p1is not zero and p2is not a multiple of p1, so
keep both of these vectors. Since p3D2p1C2p2, discard
p3. Since p4has a t2term, it cannot be a linear combination
ofp1andp2, so keep p4. Finally, p5Dp1Cp4, so discard
p5. The resulting basis is fp1;p2;p4g.
7.You would have to know that the solution set of the
homogeneous system is spanned by two solutions. In this
case, the null space of the 1820coefﬁcient matrix Ais at
most two-dimensional. By the Rank Theorem,

because Ahas 18 rows, and every equation AxDbis
consistent.
9.LetAbe the standard mnmatrix of the transformation T.
a.IfTis one-to-one, then the columns of Aare linearly

b.IfTis onto, then the columns of AspanRm(Theorem

11.IfSis a ﬁnite spanning set for V, then a subset of S—say

Exercise 19 shows that the characteristic polynomial of Cp

Suppose the result is true for nDkfor some k2, and

Thekkmatrix shown is Cq I, where
q.t/Da1Ca2tC    C aktk 1Ctk. By the induction
assumption, the determinant of Cq Iis. 1/kq./ . Thus

D. 1/kC1a0C.a 1C    C akk 1Ck/

So the formula holds for nDkC1when it holds for
nDk. By the principle of induction, the formula for
det.Cp I/is true for all n2.
23. From Exercise 22, the columns of the Vandermonde matrix
Vare eigenvectors of Cp, corresponding to the eigenvalues
1,2,3(the roots of the polynomial p). Since these
eigenvalues are distinct, the eigenvectors form a linearly
independent set, by Theorem 2 in Section 5.1. Thus Vhas
linearly independent columns and hence is invertible, by the
Invertible Matrix Theorem. Finally, since the columns of V
are eigenvectors of Cp, the Diagonalization Theorem
(Theorem 5 in Section 5.3) shows that V 1CpVis diagonal.
25. [M] If your matrix program computes eigenvalues and
eigenvectors by iterative methods rather than symbolic
calculations, you may have some difﬁculties. You should
ﬁnd that AP PDhas extremely small entries and
PDP 1is close to A. (This was true just a few years ago,
but the situation could change as matrix programs continue
to improve.) If you constructed Pfrom the program’s
eigenvectors, check the condition number of P. This may
indicate that you do not really have three linearly
independent eigenvectors.

(Explain why.) So the stated equality holds for pD2.
Suppose that the equality holds for pDk, with k2, let

By Exercise 2, kOxk2D jxv1j2C    C j xvpj2. Bessel’s

e1; : : : ; enbe the standard basis for Rn. For
jD1; : : : ; n; U ejis the jth column of U. Since

5. The given set of
equations is AxDb, and the set of all least-squares
solutions coincides with the set of solutions of
ATAxDATb(Theorem 13 in Section 6.5). Study this
equation, and use the fact that .vvT/xDv.vTx/D.vTx/v,
because vTxis a scalar.
13. a.The row–column calculation of Aushows that each row
ofAis orthogonal to every uin Nul A. So each row of
Ais in.NulA/?. Since .NulA/?is a subspace, it must
contain all linear combinations of the rows of A; hence
.NulA/?contains Row A.
b.If rank ADr, then dim Nul ADn r, by the Rank
Theorem. By Exercise 24(c) in Section 6.3,
dim Nul ACdim.NulA/?Dn
So dim .NulA/?must be r. But Row Ais an
r-dimensional subspace of .NulA/?, by the Rank
Theorem and part (a). Therefore, Row Amust coincide
with.NulA/?.
c.Replace AbyATin part (b) and conclude that Row AT
coincides with .NulAT/?. Since Row ATDColA, this
proves (c).

the theoretical bound on the relative change in xis 6.707

17. Suppose SD fb1; : : : ; bkgis an afﬁnely independent set.
Then equation (7) has a solution, because pis in aff S.
Hence equation (8) has a solution. By Theorem 5, the
homogeneous forms of the points in Sare linearly
independent. Thus (8) has a unique solution. Then (7) also
has a unique solution, because (8) encodes both equations
that appear in (7).
The following argument mimics the proof of Theorem 7 in
Section 4.4. If SD fb1; : : : ; bkgis an afﬁnely independent
set, then scalars c1; : : : ; c kexist that satisfy (7), by
deﬁnition of aff S. Suppose xalso has the representation
xDd1b1C    C dkbkand d1C    C dkD1 (7a)
for scalars d1; : : : ; d k. Then subtraction produces the
equation
0Dx xD.c1 d1/b1C    C .ck dk/bk (7b)
The weights in (7b) sum to 0 because the c’s and the d’s
separately sum to 1. This is impossible, unless each weight
in (8) is 0, because Sis an afﬁnely independent set. This
proves that ciDdiforiD1; : : : ; k .
